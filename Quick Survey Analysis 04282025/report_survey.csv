This perspective comes from years of engagement with the interdisciplinary humanities at UW and with colleagues from around the nation/world.,This is no criticism of her but a challenge to the humanities at UW:  how to interact with larger humanities communities in WY and the US without enlisting in the academic version of The Hunger Games.,"I suspect that Rachel is thinking of this but didn't have time to mention:  international fellowships.  Also, the possibility of humanities internships related to (public) research projects.",Yes,,"Rachel is a superior candidate, rooted in experience at UW/WIHR.  She has a strong research record and has created a network of colleagues worldwide.  She is the creative director we need.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overall left underwhelmed by her presentation. ,"It is all attainable, but not visionary. I believe Dr. Morris presented a much more compelling vision & plan and for these reasons, Dr. Sailor's vision felt weak and uninspiring. ","I was unclear on how WIHR would really work to serve the state beyond the university. As a land-grant school, that needs to be a part of our vision in all elements of our work.  ",With reservation,"I do not know either candidate personally or professionally, but have worked with WIRH. I did not get the sense that Dr. Sailor would be the person to lead WIRH in this moment. Her vision was narrow. ","WIRH should not simply be research generating, but balance with showcasing the societal impacts of this work to wide audiences. Appreciating humanities research by the public should be a goal too. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Optimism for new foundations/donors is not yet supported in what we're seeing on the national level.,Specific strategies are needed for supporting 1. basic humanities research through supporting grant writing and engagement and 2. strategy for cultivating larger scale projects.,With reservation,"I worry that the candidate has had many opportunities ie international work, 2fellowships, Seibold, HCI, but did not articulate how they shape her vision for WIHR or could benefit UW institutionally. ","This felt like a WIHR 1.0 approach to cultivating morale and supporting faculty who are already in the WIHR sphere.
