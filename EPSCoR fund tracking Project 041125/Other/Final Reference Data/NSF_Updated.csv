The goal of this project is to create a series of unique chemicals that dissolve e-waste metals and study the digestion and recovery processes. This project could develop a unique understanding of the essential components critical to develop an innovative technology for sustainable recovery of metals. Outreach activities include a series of course-based undergraduate research experiences to allow students to take part in the project goals.  It will also incorporate sustainable chemical principles into undergraduate teaching laboratory.<br/><br/>Redox-active ligands, chelators that induce redox events, will be designed for the oxidative dissolution of zerovalent metals from e-waste. A series of ligands based on the azothioformamide 1,3-heterodiene framework will be studied.  Both computational and experimental approaches will be coupled to investigate ligand induced dissolution and recovery of e-waste metals. Additionally, valorization, host-guest mechanism deduction, and the development of new reactions and green chemistry will be explored to build a critical materials and precious metals recycling program. Preliminary data has identified 1) a series of ligand dissection points that may govern the efficacy of oxidative dissolution; 2) that substitution patterns on ligands affect coordination of metal salts, giving clues to which ligand modifications may be most selective for dissolution / coordination; 3) recovery of metals is viable by electrochemical means and may be possible by chemical reduction to regain ligands and purify metals toward a circular, sustainable process.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal is to understand how trout fisheries in the American Mountain West region are impacted by rapidly changing climate and how stakeholders and managers are reacting to these changes to better protect mountain trout fisheries and the bio-economy that depends upon them. Trout are a flagship species, one of the most popular game fish in the United States. Trout have immense value to tourism and livelihoods in rural communities. They are also expected to be the species most heavily impacted species by climate change in mountain ecosystems. This project will also generate lesson plans for an annual event with over 150 traditionally underrepresented K-12 students aimed at increasing inclusion in natural resource conservation. A Project Advisory Committee will ensure results are translated to end-users through a white paper, blogs, and relationship building. <br/><br/>The study sites in Wyoming and Colorado include some of the most productive trout fisheries in the U.S. The project will use the Community Earth System 2 Large Ensemble Model to downscale hydro-climate data to run hydrological and ecosystem models at fisheries management-relevant scales. The ecosystem model outputs biodiversity metrics for the four species of trout characteristic of the case sites: native cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii), introduced and stocked rainbow trout (Onocorhynchus mykiss), brown trout (Salmo trutta), and brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis). These changes will then inform a large-scale social science survey of public recreationalists residing in Colorado and Wyoming and tourism companies/workers. A survey of several thousand people will ask whether changes to biodiversity will impact people?s willingness to fish and how changes to local fish may impact overall satisfaction with outdoor experiences and sourcing trout for food. Perceptions contained in the survey will then feed into interview questions to engage decision-maker stakeholders at the federal, state, local, and tribal governments as well as NGOs and outfitting companies about how changes to climate, biodiversity, and public preferences on outdoor recreation can be met with changes to public policy and collaborative management.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because of this, snow hydrology research in recent years has used a variety of techniques to model and observe snowmelt processes. However, a disconnect between observed physical processes and modeling capabilities has been revealed, exposing a need to improve understanding of snowmelt dynamics. This research will fill a knowledge gap in understanding how the snowpack stores and transmits liquid water to streams. This project will develop a snowmelt monitoring program for both research and educational opportunities. Scientific advancements will be made while also providing experiential learning opportunities for both university and K-12 students across Wyoming, including Native American populations in the Wind River Reservation. In total, two Ph.D. students and one M.S. student will be involved in scientific research while approximately 20 undergraduate students, 300 high school students, and 1,250 middle school students will gain a broad understanding of hydrologic sciences through outreach and field activities. Through field observations and modeling, this project will identify when and where common model representations of snowmelt processes need to be improved. The results will be broadly applicable rather than specific to individual watersheds for the purpose of improving future streamflow forecasting models to benefit stakeholders across the United States and beyond. <br/><br/>The overall scope of this NSF CAREER project is to improve fundamental knowledge of the hydro-terrestrial system in headwater catchments and produce transformational understanding of hydrologic fluxes within a snowpack. This project will test a model structure that includes representation of previously observed liquid water dynamics in a snowpack that are not currently included in models. Thus, the overarching goals of this proposal are to: 1) Develop a long-term monitoring program to define a snowpack?s role in storing and transmitting liquid water to streams under various conditions; and 2) develop a long-term educational program that promotes mountain hydrology across the University of Wyoming campus and STEM education to underrepresented groups. This project will use a combination of traditional hydrology field work, geophysical observations of a melting snowpack, and advanced modeling techniques to conduct investigations. The results of this work will identify when and where consideration of the snowpack as an ?extension of the vadose zone? is important for hydrologic modeling based on watershed characteristics while providing unique experiential learning opportunities for students at the University of Wyoming and beyond.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Water, Landscape, and Critical Zone Processes program,and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The tendency for policymakers to favor reactive solutions while neglecting proactive preventative efforts is perhaps most evident in the context of natural disasters. The benefits of investment in risk reduction can be intangible, particularly if it avoids a disaster, but the mobilization of aid to communities experiencing a natural disaster provides visible outcomes. This illustrates a broader public policy-behavioral dilemma called The Intangibility of Public Policy. The implication is that intangibility of outcomes will cause people to undervalue risk reduction investments and policies, which will lead to excessive levels of public risk.<br/><br/>The project involves a survey experiment that leverages wildfire exposure and forest management to investigate the behavioral implications of the intangibility of wildfire risk reduction. Using secondary data, the researchers identify wildfire relevant locations (zip codes) that were exposed and not exposed to a Type 1/severe wildfire in 2024 and that had hazardous fuels forest thinning in the previous two-year period (pre-thinning) or are planned to have thinning in the subsequent two-year periods (post-thinning). Across the wildfire and management conditions, the survey experiment considers (i) how people perceive the reduction in wildfire risk from previous and planned forest thinning, (ii) people?s preferences for the allocation of wildfire risk reduction investment between prevention and suppression activities, and (iii) people?s willingness to take individual action to reduce wildfire risks. Comparisons across exposure and management conditions provide insights to how people perceive, respond, and support risk reduction following a disaster. This research builds on established interdisciplinary insights in behavioral economics, risk perception, and public policy, with a focus on natural disaster management.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The type of parts depends on the nature of the object at hand. This proposal is focused on questions amenable to a dyadic approach: the simpler parts are usually some variation of a small, square signal which takes only two values. Huge advancements have been made since Stefanie Petermichl?s discovery in 2000, that one of the most studied operators in analysis, the Hilbert transform, can be expressed in a meaningful way as an average of such simple operators. Central to this project will be the advancement of Petermichl?s work by relating it to several long-standing open questions in harmonic analysis. An especially exciting path will be building a bridge between two ?competing? methods in modern harmonic analysis, the Bellman function method and the sparse operator domination approach. This has the likelihood of becoming a new ?method? in its own, as it involves new ideas from two leading methods in harmonic analysis. The project further includes organization of activities in harmonic analysis, as well as working with and training graduate students.<br/> <br/>The starting point is an open problem on the dyadic square function which has baffled the field for quite some time. Here, weighted inequalities, specifically with Muckenhoupt weights, will be settled. These types of inequalities have recently dominated modern harmonic analysis, and the dyadic square function is one of the most important operators in the field - especially because it can be viewed as the starting point of Littlewood-Paley theory. The question to then tackle will be the sharp power of the Muckenhoupt characteristic in the weak norm in the Hilbert space setting (parameter p=2). All other situations except the Hilbert space setting (p not equal to 2) are known, which makes it even more strange that this question is still open ? usually, the Hilbert space setting is the ?simple? case one extracts all other values from. However, the nonlinear nature of the dyadic square function turns this all on its head, in a quite unique situation. The planned approach, to merge new ideas for Bellman functions with new ideas for sparse operators, has seen significant recent progress. Much broader applications of this approach are anticipated as well.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project uses ecological stoichiometry to study the evolutionary effects of predation by fish on zooplankton, the tiny animals they eat. Some high mountain lakes have been stocked with trout for fishing while others remain naturally fishless. Trout eat the largest zooplankton which in turn impacts the population of zooplankton by altering the timing and number of young produced. Over time, this can have an evolutionary effect on the chemical balance of zooplankton and the lake environment itself. This project will examine these differences in chemical balance in high mountain lakes with and without trout. The results are important for predicting the impacts of natural and human-induced environmental change. The project will also produce a unit for college students in a large introductory biology course to improve understanding of the effects of chemical balance and changes on the environment. <br/> <br/>Specifically, this project addresses a knowledge gap by studying intraspecific variation in elemental traits and its effects on ecological processes in lakes. For the first objective, high precision instruments are used to contrast the elemental content between Daphnia populations from lakes with introduced trout, possessing distinct reproductive traits, and Daphnia populations from naturally fishless lakes. By quantifying all detectable biologically essential elements in these two distinct phenotypes, this work will reveal the elemental consequences of life-history traits, which are largely unknown. For the second objective, the mismatch between consumers and their resources (between Daphnia and phytoplankton and between phytoplankton and lake water) will be quantified to assess the effect of trout introductions on the balance of elements between trophic levels.  In an experiment, I will also assess how intraspecific variation in elemental recycling by Daphnia differentially alters algal uptake and growth rate. Because all shifts in life-history traits require shifts in elemental requirements, differences between the effects of distinct phenotypes will occur but the magnitude of these differences is unknown. The findings will provide critical insights into the likely consequences of intraspecific variation across levels of biological organization, from organisms to ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This work will be conducted in collaboration with researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.  A long-standing challenge to the economical production of lipid-based biofuels, such as biodiesel, relates to how and when cells accumulate lipids. Lipid accumulation is triggered upon cell stress severe enough that it also arrests cell growth; therefore, cells must first be grown and then transferred to different conditions to trigger significant lipid accumulation. We have developed a simple system in which the bacterium Rhodococcus opacus PD630 grows on a dilute agricultural by-product with significant lipid accumulation during growth. This system is unique because it outperforms attempts to engineer microbial lipid accumulation during growth. The goals of this work are to: 1) identify which feature(s) of the agricultural by-product stimulates lipid accumulation during growth for identification of other cheap, abundant feedstocks and 2) understand how cells accumulate lipids during growth so this can be engineered into other microbial systems for economical bioproduction. To accomplish this, the deep expertise in lipid-accumulating microbes at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory will be leveraged to understand how our unique system works. The results of this project will be used to identify strategies to engineer other microbial systems for a simpler, more economical production of renewable, lipid-based biofuels and biochemicals. This project directly addresses a long-standing challenge for economical microbial biofuel production.<br/><br/>The overall goal of the project is to identify targets for the forward engineering of other systems to stimulate lipid accumulation during growth for economical microbial lipid production. This research directly addresses a long-standing challenge to economic microbial lipid production with the overall goal of moving to a renewable bioeconomy for fuels and materials.  The PI developed a system in which the bacterium Rhodococcus opacus PD630 grows on a dilute agricultural by-product with significant lipid accumulation during growth, with biomass accumulation to ~3 g/L (dry weight) in 48 hours of batch culture. The collected biomass is 43% fatty acids, which is equal to that observed when R. opacus PD630 is grown on glucose and growth-arrested for ideal lipid accumulation conditions in the laboratory. This NSF EPSCoR RII EPSCoR Research Fellows project will support the PI and a graduate student to work with an expert in lipid-accumulating microbes at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Working together, the PI and collaborator will determine: 1) which characteristics of the dilute agricultural by-product are critical for lipid accumulation during growth and 2) which metabolic pathways are active when cells accumulate lipids during growth. The dilute agricultural by-product will be characterized by the measurement of total organic carbon, inorganic carbon, total nitrogen, major and minor ions, as well as organic acids and sugars in the by-product before, during, and after growth. Individual components will be added to the medium to assess impacts on lipid accumulation. Metabolic pathways active during simultaneous growth and lipid accumulation will be identified through transcriptomic, lipidomic, and untargeted metabolomic analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Grid-scale energy storage is a longstanding and unmet need to support the sustainable production of electricity from intermittent sources such as wind and solar. Flow batteries offer a compelling engineering framework for providing inexpensive energy storage because they permit independent scaling of their power conversion and energy storage components. This project supports investigation of the fundamental electrochemical behavior of metal chelate materials as sustainable and scalable energy storage materials in flow batteries. This project also supports the development of new education and outreach programs in battery chemistry, with the goal of creating a competitive and equitable US workforce in clean energy technologies.<br/><br/>The goal of the project aims to provide a fundamental molecular understanding of a broad class of metal chelate coordination complexes, coupled with the evaluation of these chemical phenomena to improve system level flow battery performance. This understanding will be accomplished through the evaluation of the ability of organic chelates to inhibit water splitting reactions and test its performance limits. This approach will then be expanded to develop metal chelate complexes that can undergo multi-electron redox reactions, which can further increase the energy density and performance of the flow battery systems. This project represents a new approach to address longstanding challenges in the field of energy storage with low-cost materials that are economically feasible for wide scale deployment. Moreover, this project not only could prove transformative for enabling high-voltage aqueous batteries, but the molecular inhibition of water splitting using chelates could also carry wider implications for controlling hydrogen evolution reactions in other electrochemical and electrocatalytic applications such as electrochemical fuel production.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Resource-bounded measure is a tool that has been successful in understanding the computational complexity of decision problems. In this project, we will extend resource-bounded measure to operate in the function problem setting.

These new martingales will allow for the formulation and analysis of more complex prediction strategies, filling a significant gap in computational complexity theory and extending the application of measure theory more broadly.

Graduate students themselves have identified the need for training in these translational skills before embarking on their post-graduation careers. Yet, most scientists receive no formal training in scicomm and report feeling ill-equipped to share science effectively. Scicomm training is not widely embraced in academia due to systemic barriers that impede and devalue both study and training in scicomm. Working at an unprecedented scale, SciComm LIFT will survey, train, and support thousands of graduate students -- across the country and across institution types -- for the top skills required by employers: oral and written communication and collaboration. SciComm LIFT's emphasis on ethical scicomm training will also directly enhance graduate degree programs and professional development programs, ensuring early career scientists are more capable of doing and sharing science in ways that meet the needs of society and foster public trust in and of science.<br/><br/>SciComm LIFT uses expectancy values theory to address three issues: (1) most scicomm training programs prioritize knowledge gains and skills, but ignore the human/ethical elements of scicomm that are vital to science that fosters public trust; (2) existing scicomm training is rarely assessed, making it difficult for trainers and programs to optimize programming and demonstrate its efficacy; (3) long-standing, systemic barriers impede integration of ethical scicomm training. In Aim 1, SciComm LIFT will conduct a broadly distributed, systems-scoping survey (Motivations to Engage in Scicomm Advancement; MESA) of graduate students, faculty, and staff to (1) assess current knowledge, motivations, and self-efficacy around ethical scicomm and (2) quantify the extent of training addressing ethical dimensions of scicomm. MESA will be made available to the research and graduate education community as a validated, reliable instrument tested across contexts and institutions. Aim 2 is a multi-institutional study to gauge the impact of three ethical scicomm interventions in graduate programs, which will provide much-needed data that can be used to calibrate scicomm training programs nationwide.

Such environments abound in our world, for example, urban shopping districts, tropical forests, underwater reefs, and undeveloped islands. These locations are typically inaccessible and resource-limited for human operations, and they evolve slowly but substantially over time (e.g., propagating vegetation). However, ?being right there? in these environments and responding to events at multiple time scales is critical, especially for environmental protection. Therefore, in this project plant-inspired robots will be designed to monitor and react to long-term processes like pollution spread, humidity levels, and seasonal migration of animal groups, as well as randomly occurring real-time events like pollution outbreaks, forest fires, and sightings of rare animals. To this end, the research team will abstract different capacities of plants?their distributed movements from slow to ballistic speed, adaptation according to ambient conditions, and energy harvesting processes?to establish new approaches toward robotic structure, motion, and functionality. On the education and outreach front, the award will support curriculum development in bio-inspired robotics, participation of undergraduate students in research, and outreach activities for middle school girls.<br/><br/>The objective of this research is to enable development of plant-inspired robots capable of long-duration service in complex, dynamic environments by pursuing significant innovations in structural, energetic, and operational designs of robots, e.g., robotic hardware that mimics plant-like ?growth? and adaptation; advancement in robotic movements to cover both real-time events (seconds/minutes) and long-term processes (weeks/months); and energy harvesting components for long-duration autonomy. The research team will achieve the objective by: (1) leveraging origami principles to create robotic ?trunk? components capable of discrete and energy efficient growth-like deformations via folding and self-locking; (2) using principles from continuum robots to devise ?leaf? and ?needle? components capable of continuous and short-duration motions for monitoring and manipulating the ambient environment; (3) laying down the foundation for energy autonomy by exploring diverse energy harvesting approaches similar to those that plants employ; and (4) integration to enable multiple time-scale operations.

Free probability began as a subfield of the theory of von Neumann algebras, which in turn originated in a series of papers by Murray and von Neumann in the 1930s, as part of an effort to provide mathematical foundations for quantum mechanics.  A key concept in free probability is the notion of free independence, which generalizes the classical notion of independence of random variables, enabling the development of a robust ?noncommutative probability theory? in the setting of von Neumann algebras, where rich mathematical structure emerges from the interactions of objects known as free random variables (owing in part to the fact that their multiplication, like that of matrices of complex numbers, is not commutative).  Methods from free probability are now a cornerstone of the structure theory of certain von Neumann algebras, and have applications to a variety of other fields, including random matrix theory and quantum information theory.  In this project, the PI will study several important open problems on probability distributions of free random variables and explore their applications to random matrix models.  The project integrates research with education and will provide research opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students, complemented by outreach initiatives to teach and mentor middle school and high school students, with a particular emphasis on supporting students from underrepresented backgrounds.  <br/> <br/>The Brown measure of a free random variable is analogous to the eigenvalue counting measure of a square matrix. It is an extension of spectral measures of normal operators to non-normal operators. This measure encodes a great deal of information and can predict the limiting distributions of non-Hermitian random matrix models. In this project, the PI seeks to develop analytic techniques for computing the Brown measures of a diverse range of free random variables, motivated by operator algebras, random matrix theory, and high-dimensional statistics. The boundary values of certain operator-valued subordination functions will be explored using tools in complex analysis, operator algebras, and noncommutative analysis. The project will investigate random variables formed through addition, multiplication, or polynomials of free random variables. The new Brown measure results will then be used to analyze limiting laws and the convergence of non-Hermitian random matrix models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Variation in abundances is used to determine patterns of synchrony (i.e. correlations in abundances), which influence species extinction risk and the stability of ecosystems. Patterns of synchrony are driven by many factors, such as variability in temperature or precipitation, or the dispersal patterns of species themselves. To date, research on synchrony has primarily focused on the role of the environment as an external force driving synchrony, both across locations and across species. However, traits, which define characteristics of species, likely play major roles in regulating synchrony. Further, different traits might determine patterns of synchrony in different environmental conditions. This research combines plant composition data from a global grassland experiment with collections of species trait data to test how traits determine patterns of synchrony across environmental gradients. The researchers will additionally lead a virtual global seminar for grassland ecologists on integrating experimental data with ecological theory. The grant will support multiple students in attending and networking at an annual working group meeting that brings together grassland scientists. This research will enhance understanding of the processes that determine ecosystem variability, aiding our ability to manage ecosystems and predict responses to future environmental change.<br/><br/>Synchrony is a ubiquitous phenomenon across ecological levels of organization and is driven by both biotic factors and abiotic environmental drivers. At the population level, correlations in temporal abundance fluctuations across distinct locations (i.e., population synchrony) increase species' extinction risk. In communities, correlated fluctuations among species in a given location (i.e., community synchrony) decreases ecosystem stability. Species traits (morphological, physiological, and phenological characteristics of species) and trait-by-environment interactions likely play major roles in regulating synchrony. The project integrates multi-site time series data from a global distributed experiment (the Nutrient Network) with novel trait collection, existing trait databases, and methods development to create and empirically test frameworks for linking functional traits to synchrony across scales of ecological organization under both natural conditions and experimental treatments that alter herbivory patterns and nutrient enrichment. The research will synthesize multiple trait databases and collect new data on traits hypothesized to mechanistically affect synchrony, characterizing how trait composition within ecological communities responds to increased fertilization and decreased herbivory pressure. Trait data, coupled with long-term time series data of plant composition, will be used to assess how trait variation and trait-by-environment interactions influence population and community synchrony across environmental gradients.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This fundamental definition implies that soil thaws at 0°C or that ground-ice melts at 0°C. However, if salts or salty water are present (saline permafrost), the earth material can thaw or remain unfrozen at temperatures below 0°C. Saline permafrost is widespread in the terrestrial arctic environment, occurring across ~35% of the continuous permafrost region. The impacts of warming saline permafrost on natural processes in the Arctic and its reaction to climate change have received little research attention to date. The Thaw Below Zero project is an important next step in studies of permafrost responses to a warming Arctic because saline permafrost is degrading more quickly than other types of permafrost. Knowledge of saline permafrost dynamics in a warming world can better inform earth system models that predict global climate change. Information exchanges with local and regional land management agencies on the effects of warming saline permafrost on natural and human-modified Arctic environments will assist in community resilience and future planning efforts. The project will broaden participation through the inclusion of undergraduate students from I?isa?vik College in Utqia?vik, a graduate student at the University of Wyoming, and an early career female researcher at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. This project addresses policy elements identified in the FY2022-26 Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee Arctic Research Plan related to permafrost and its role in Arctic system interactions as well as risk management and hazard mitigation.<br/><br/>Warming of permafrost across the Northern Hemisphere has been well documented. Since the 1980s, the mean annual temperature of cold, continuous permafrost in northern Alaska has increased by 2-3°C. Nevertheless, this region is typically considered to be relatively safe from permafrost degradation since ground temperatures remain well below 0°C. However, considering the high ground-ice content in saline soils of the upper permafrost in northern Alaska, we may expect extensive thaw settlement and an increase in landscape change rates because of permafrost warming and thawing at temperatures below 0°C. The Thaw Below Zero project will advance fundamentals of permafrost science, contribute to a better understanding of permafrost evolution in a warming Arctic, and provide a basis for predicting climate change impacts on permafrost terrain by clarifying the effect of warming saline permafrost on key natural landscape processes in the Arctic. The project will combine permafrost field studies, laboratory soil testing, geophysical field and laboratory measurements, environmental sensor networks, and remote sensing to (1) study the spatial distribution and properties of saline permafrost; (2) assess how ice wedge formation and subsequent thaw in the Holocene have influenced the depth to and distribution of near-surface saline permafrost; and (3) determine the response of warming saline permafrost below shallow thermokarst lakes. The primary research product of these combined objectives will be the establishment of quantitative relationships between salinity, permafrost characteristics, and Arctic landscape change processes and their rates. Project results will fill fundamental knowledge gaps in the evolution of Arctic permafrost landscapes and provide necessary information for characterizing and understanding future permafrost landscape behavior.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Food security, food nutritional quality, and the viability of disadvantaged communities are especially threatened by climate change. An educated application of Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) provides one avenue to mitigate climate pressure on tribal communities and meet future food demand in a sustainable manner. Advances in and widespread adoption of CEA are, however, limited by several factors. Significant knowledge gaps exist in the science underpinning CEA. Additionally, there has been limited investment in relevant research, community engagement, and workforce development. This project is a collaboration among community colleges, universities, tribal nations, and community organizations located in three NSF EPSCoR jurisdictions: University of New Mexico, New Mexico State University, and Santa Fe Community College (New Mexico); University of Wyoming (Wyoming); and University of South Dakota and Sicangu Community Development Corporation (South Dakota). The three collaborating jurisdictions are home to 36 federal reservations. The project team brings together community members and researchers from diverse fields (e.g., economists, engineers, biologists, and plant physiologists) and consists of early-career, mid-career, and established researchers. This project provides opportunities for learning among universities, community colleges, industry, and tribal communities to allow for the development of tailored CEA systems and a climate-smart and community-based workforce. The human and information infrastructure developed under this project is anticipated to attract and retain talent, stimulate economic development, and confer climate resilience in tribal communities within and across jurisdictions.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to empirically determine best practices for secure CEA food production and to quantify the socio-economic impacts of CEA on tribal communities across the collaborating EPSCoR jurisdictions. The project proposes to take a convergence science approach to tackling food security under climate change, drawing upon diverse expertise with researchers ranging from basic (plant physiology and plant-microbe interactions) and applied biology (CEA and horticulture), environmental and natural resource economics, engineering, sustainability science, and applied knowledge of tribal community members. The research project leverages each institution's unique and complementary research expertise and resources to accomplish the following three objectives: (1) characterize how the environment, plants, and microbes interact in hydroponic systems and affect crop yield and nutritional quality; (2) identify environmental, nutritional, and socio-economic drivers and impacts of CEA on tribal communities to enhance climate resilience strategies via CEA; and (3) empower tribal communities through interdisciplinary training aimed at long-term retention of a highly-skilled climate-smart CEA workforce. The project includes training and mentoring activities for undergraduate and graduate students, post-doctoral scholars, early career faculty, and various tribal communities, including farmers, students K-12, and industry personnel. This project is funded by the EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement-Focused EPSCoR Collaborations (RII-FEC) program. The RII-FEC program builds inter-jurisdictional collaborative teams of EPSCoR investigators in focus areas consistent with the NSF Strategic Plan. RII-FEC projects include researchers from at least two EPSCoR jurisdictions with complementary expertise and resources necessary to address challenges, which neither party could address as well or as rapidly independently.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Impacts to earth surface processes are nowhere more evident than surface mines, including landscapes throughout the western United States. Two post-mining reclamation methods have emerged since the passage of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act in 1977, with the stipulation that the land be restored to ?approximate original contour.?  The traditional approach led to the creation of steep, uniform hillslopes that failed to replicate the diversity of natural landforms. One of the more severe results of the traditional reclamation method was a dramatic increase in erosion rates and sediment export from reclaimed hillslopes, with subsequent impacts to ecological function. In contrast to traditional reclamation, a more recent approach results in the approximate reconstruction of the pre-mining landscape by mimicking adjacent natural landforms and reflecting the original surface features or geomorphology, but impacts to ecological processes and economic outcomes are not well understood. This project examines the consequences of the two reclamation practices ranging from hydrologic to vegetative functions at a series of geomorphic and traditional reclamation sites in central Wyoming.  <br/><br/>Ecological and hydrologic conditions will be measured along reclamation chronosequences (a sequence of differently aged traditional and geomorphically reclaimed sites) using field, remote sensing, and modeling techniques. Data will assess the impacts of topographic restructuring on vegetation recruitment, species composition and diversity, soil moisture, surface runoff, erosion and sediment export, and snow accumulation.  At the same time, empirical recovery functions using both cost and environmental metrics will be calculated to serve the goal of evaluating each reclamation technique for meeting restoration objectives and economic cost effectiveness, informing policy makers.  An interdisciplinary research team will train students to evaluate dynamic relationships between ecological metrics and economic costs and benefits that match geographic and policy scales. Roundtable discussions will facilitate regulatory-based alternatives to assist public and agency land management goals. Analyzing a series of reclamation sites over time will provide a more comprehensive picture of land recovery outcomes and address questions of importance to sustainable ecosystem management and ecological reclamation of disturbed landscapes. Results of this project will develop baseline data needed globally for successful post-disturbance land recovery and can guide future reclamation efforts in the western United States.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Electrons carry a magnetic moment ? from their spin ? as well as a charge, so it is natural to ask whether magnetization currents or waves might also flow unimpeded through a superconductor.  In the majority of superconductors, the answer is negative, since the spins in the electron pairs responsible for superconductivity are anti-aligned and no net spin transport can occur. However, theory predicts that electrons could also pair up in ?spin-symmetric? configurations, creating unusual new superconducting states with unique applications in spin transport, quantum memory and topologically-protected quantum logic. Spin-symmetric superconductivity is challenging to achieve (usually being quenched by disorder or static magnetic ordering) and hard to unambiguously distinguish from conventional pairing. The goal of this work is to explore new methods for stabilizing spin-symmetric pairing in a range of atomically thin multilayers comprising superconductors, heavy metallic elements and magnetic materials.  New experimental apparatus ? a low-temperature microwave transmission/absorption spectrometer ? is being built to detect long-range spin transport in these materials and hence facilitate identification of the exact pairing symmetry. Students trained within this project are ideally qualified to join the local workforce for the new quantum computing TechHub recently established in the Mountain West.  The principal investigator is also strengthening links with a local Tribal-serving community college in Wyoming, by offering four summer research internships which explicitly target Native American undergraduates.<br/> <br/>Technical Description:<br/>Superconductivity is mediated by electron pairs, which possess antisymmetric (singlet) spins in the vast majority of cases. There is no fundamental barrier to spin-symmetric (triplet) pairing, but the conditions for its emergence are rarely satisfied in bulk materials. However, there is a growing recognition that two phenomena more familiar to spintronics researchers ? chiral magnetism and spin-orbit coupling ? may hold the keys to developing artificial multilayers which host stable spin-symmetric pairs. Achieving such control over the superconducting order parameter opens the door to topological superconductivity and/or dissipationless spin transport, with hotly-anticipated applications in quantum and classical information. Motivated by these targets, this project explores three distinct approaches to modify the pairing symmetry of ultra-thin film superconducting heterostructures grown by electron-beam evaporation: (1) Generating odd-frequency s-wave triplet pairs from spin-mixing and rotation in superconductor/non-collinear magnet hybrid multilayers; (2) Inducing chiral p-wave pairing by synthetic spin-orbit and Zeeman fields from a proximate magnetic skyrmion lattice; (3) Creating odd-parity triplet pairs via Rashba spin-orbit coupling and broken spatial inversion symmetry at superconducting heterointerfaces.  These unconventional pairing states are distinguishable via microwave spectroscopic techniques, with the construction of a unique new broadband transmission/absorption probe a priority for the project. Enhanced spin-pumping and macroscopic spin transport allow inference of the presence of triplet pairing, while nodal odd-parity order parameters can be detected from the temperature-dependent superfluid density. Demonstrating the emergence and resilience of these exotic pairing symmetries in the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling can accelerate their adoption by quantum technologies, especially in material platforms for topological quantum computing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Traditional authentication methods like PINs, passwords, facial recognition and fingerprints are proving inadequate and vulnerable to attacks. This vulnerability is further exacerbated by the nature of immersive environments, where users' attention is often diverted from external stimuli, making traditional authentication methods less reliable. Additionally, biometric methods face challenges such as susceptibility to presentation attacks, where adversaries attempt to deceive the system using fake biometric data, further emphasizing the necessity for advanced authentication mechanisms tailored specifically for AR and VR systems. This project aims to address these challenges by leveraging Electroencephalography (EEG) signals, which measure the electrical activity in a user's brain. The objective is to develop and revolutionize user authentication methods to both secure and enhance human-computer interaction within AR/VR environments.  Additionally, the proposed effort includes educational activities for both undergraduate and graduate students; and activities for broadening participation in STEM fields. Through research, education, and outreach efforts, the project seeks to shape the trajectory of emerging technology toward a more secure and equitable digital landscape.<br/><br/>The goal of this work is to develop novel user authentication algorithms tailored specifically for AR/VR systems.

Understanding and ultimately predicting kinematics is of practical significance for industry and society. However, numerical simulation of all fluid scales in practical problems using uniform spatial resolution is severely intractable due to the energy transfer from the largest turbulent eddies that cascade down to the smallest eddies, where kinetic energy dissipates into heat. For example, the fluid length scales for a wind turbine span hundreds of meters down to microns, a multi-scale problem encompassing more than ten orders of magnitude. Adaptive mesh refinement alleviates this issue by discretizing the spatial domain into mesh elements of variable resolution and dynamically and strategically placing mesh points to capture the most meaningful fluid dynamics for a reasonable solution. This project addresses the challenge of accurately and efficiently simulating computational fluid dynamics problems by developing an open-source, general-purpose framework with dynamically adaptive mesh refinement on unstructured grids composed of mixed element types. The recent shift in high-performance computing hardware towards graphics processing units has brought significant advancements in computing throughput and energy usage but necessitates new algorithms and software. This project bridges the critical gaps in this transition by co-designing efficient numerical methods for these architectures in a dynamically changing mesh environment. Furthermore, this program integrates education into its mission. Post-secondary students and early-career researchers will be exposed to and trained for developing GPU-enabled software, aiming to cultivate a diverse and globally competitive workforce.<br/><br/>The technical objective of this project is to create a GPU-enabled open-source computational fluid dynamics framework for modeling the compressible Navier Stokes equations, discretized using the high-order accurate discontinuous Galerkin method, on dynamically adapting mixed-element unstructured meshes.

Further, an emphasis is placed on solving application problems containing relative body motion, such as blade-resolved wind turbine and helicopter simulations, while addressing software complexity issues, inadequate error estimation capabilities, and geometry complexity. The framework aims to provide a more streamlined and simpler-to-use workflow, requiring minimal human intervention, which runs seamlessly on modern large-scale supercomputing architectures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Infectious diseases are a significant threat to amphibian survival.  Ranavirosis is caused by Frog Virus 3 (FV3), and causes disease and death in wild and captive amphibians worldwide.  FV3 infections of wild tadpoles often result in die-offs of populations reaching close to 100% mortality, a rate that significantly impacts the stability of future wild frog populations. If RV3 moves into captive amphibian populations, it jeopardized breeding programs of endangered species. There must be an understanding of FV3?s pathogenesis (how infection develops in the host) to mitigate ranavirosis. Pathogenesis of FV3 is influenced by many things including: the amphibian?s immune response to infection, and environmental factors linked to the amphibian?s life history, such as sharing habitat with species that serve as virus reservoirs (carriers) or living under unfavorable conditions. This CAREER award will investigate the pathogenesis of FV3 in wood frogs, a native frog species severely affected by outbreaks of ranavirosis. It focuses on the frog?s response to infection, the effects of environment (temperature changes), stress, and presence carriers on infection outcomes. This research funds basic research whose findings will inform decisions in management of wild and captive amphibians. Training of graduate students in this research area will also prepare the next generation of STEM researchers for the workforce. In addition, there are outreach activities to inform the general public about FV3 and frogs to help educate people about current threats to wildlife.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL OVERVIEW<br/><br/>It is theorized that FV3 introduction into a naïve population of wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) will result in local extinction within 5 years. The investigator?s central hypothesis is that the life history (biology and ecology) of the host, its immune response, and the environment it inhabits will determine the outcome of FV3 infection. The PIs previous work found that survivors of sublethal FV3 infections (like green frogs, Rana clamitans) may become long-term carriers of the virus. Thus, environments with green frogs may be associated with ranavirosis tadpole mortalities in wild populations. The proposed research will determine the pathogenesis of infection in tadpoles, disentangle the relationship between (putatively) resistant species (green frogs) and highly susceptible ones (wood frogs); determine if long-term carriers develop when individuals survive infection; characterize the cellular and/or humoral immune response to FV3 infection in adult wood frogs; and determine whether subclinical disease provides protection to re-infection. The work will involve experimental infections of wild-caught, lab-raised, tadpoles and adults, determination of LD50 doses, histopathological examination of affected animals, application of immunohistochemical and molecular labeling (in situ hybridization) techniques to detect target cells/tissues, hematological evaluation of cellular and humoral immune responses, and determination of the effect of corticosteroids on those responses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Due to the massive scale of data, it is difficult to detect anomalies that occur at different spatial and temporal resolutions. In addition, human movements are often associated with different categories of places (e.g., grocery stores and schools), and anomalies that are evident in one category may be obscure in another. This project will furnish new mathematical models and theories for encoding different categories of human movements as spatial-temporal multilayer networks. It will develop new algorithms to detect movement-pattern anomalies, which can help better forewarn anomalous events concerning national security.

The hydrothermal systems affect water quality and weaken the overlying rocks further increasing the likelihood of major landslides. Larger volcanic eruptions may impact air traffic and therefore disrupt the global economy. Several of these geohazards occurred during the large 2011-12 eruption of Cordón Caulle, Chile, with its volcanic ash plume reaching large parts of South America including Buenos Aires. The natural hazards continue to pose a major risk for the region, because the eruption was accompanied by a shallow intrusion of magma that has established a vigorous hydrothermal system within a steep edifice scarred by numerous large surface cracks, indicative of slope instability. This eruption sequence, the near-surface intrusion, and its surroundings present a unique opportunity to advance our understanding of the genesis and current state of this recently formed intrusion, which serves as a model for near-surface magmatic intrusions globally. The goal of this project is ability to evaluate and understand the natural hazards associated with intrusions, in particular those arising from the interactions between surface processes, hydrothermal, and magmatic processes. Furthermore, the proposed work aims to advance our understanding of how volcanic eruptions transition from explosive to effusive behavior and these transitions may lead to the formation of shallow intrusions. In addition to building a strong US-Chilean collaborative effort with this project, the team will facilitate a large community-research component, where students will be invited to participate in field and other research activities.<br/><br/>Subduction zones create volcanic arcs that are dynamic environments of steep terrain built and modified by the interplay between volcanic, plutonic, and landscape processes. Water acts as the key agent for dynamical interactions, in the form of the hydrothermal system that exists in the shallow subsurface and in the form of erosional processes. Understanding of how the magmatic-hydrothermal sphere and surface- and hydrosphere interact when volcanic activity fundamentally alters the landscape on decadal time scales remains a major challenge. The proposed project is centered around the 2011-12 Córdon Caulle laccolith, one of the most dynamic landscapes on Earth. It is unique because of the intersection of an active plutonic and volcanic realm with the shallow subsurface and surface. It affords the opportunity to study ongoing processes that act at the intersection of magma pathways to the surface, shallow magma intrusion, hydrosphere, and surface. The focus will be on enhancing knowledge about laccolith initiation and development through the integration of existing and newly proposed observations with geophysical and geochemical models, in order to ascertain the current state of the system and project its future evolution. The project combines methods of volcanology, geophysics, aqueous geochemistry, and geomorphology. It will add new insight into the internal and external processes that build and modify near-surface intrusions. It aims to answer why buoyant magma, despite having already an open path to the surface, intruded laterally within hundreds of meters of the surface. Beyond exploration of laccolith genesis, the project seeks to provide a basis for assessing its current state and future evolution through the integration of a wide range of existing and newly proposed observations of structure, mass and heat flux in and out of the intrusion, and its surface evolution as modulated by the interior and exterior processes. The project will foster international collaborations that strengthen scientific relationships between the US and Chile. The project will have an open structure that actively broadens the science community working on this volcanic system via a field school component. An outreach component will involve rural middle schools that are directly affected by regional volcanism.

Although less than one-fifth of the U.S. population lives in rural areas, these areas encompass about 97% of the total land area in the United States and thus the population density for rural areas is low. Traditionally, mainstream epidemiological models focus on settings with high population density, such as major U.S. cities. To study rural epidemiology, it is necessary to develop epidemiological models and analyses tailored to the unique demographics and geographic isolation of rural areas. This grant brings together expertise in mathematical modeling, high-performance computing, geographic information systems, and medical sociology to develop a framework for reliable and accurate real-time epidemic forecasts for mountain-West States, such as Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, and Colorado. The project involves constructing a data-driven multiscale mobility network, using the combination of de-biased mobile phone data, American Community Survey (ACS), and census data in these regions. With a multiscale mobility network, the principal investigators (PIs) will be able to examine how containment policies during a pandemic, such as mobility reduction interventions, stay-at-home orders, and State border lockdowns, impact the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases, and how such policies may exacerbate the disparities of public health and social inequalities in rural areas. The study will help government health officials develop equitable policies and mitigation strategies for rural places in the future epidemic. Furthermore, the proposed community outreach will raise awareness of disease prevention in Wyoming.<br/> <br/>This grant offers solutions to three research questions in rural epidemiology: Q1. How to construct a metapopulation mobility network tailored to rural places? Human mobility is one of the factors driving the spread of infectious diseases across wide geographical ranges. The project introduces a metapopulation model embedded in a multiscale data-driven mobility network tailored to the unique structures of rural population density and human moving patterns for simulating infection dynamics of the front-range States. For this metapopulation mobility model, the PIs will adapt and improve the efficiency of Gillespie?s event-driven algorithms and derive a proper time step for large-scale stochastic simulations. The PIs will also implement an efficient particle filter algorithm for data assimilations to estimate local transmission parameters at two scales. Q2. How to detect and correct mobile phone data bias? If the bias of the mobile phone data used to construct the mobility networks is not addressed, infection dynamics simulations may incorrectly estimate the severity and speed of disease transmission. The project will investigate the bias of mobile phone data used to construct the mobility network and develop a method to offset the data bias. Q3. What are the impacts of containment measures on disadvantaged racial and socioeconomic groups? The PIs will use the proposed unbiased multiscale metapopulation mobility model to study the impacts of temporary mobility reductions and their lasting behavior-modifying effects on the disadvantaged racial and socioeconomic groups in the front-range States.<br/><br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the MPS Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) through the Mathematical Biology Program, the SBE Division of Social and Economic Sciences (SES), and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This event completely changed the trajectory of the evolutionary tree of life, leading ultimately to the formation of today?s mammal-dominated communities. The aftermath of the K/Pg mass extinction represents a natural laboratory in which ecosystem reorganization can be studied with high geologic resolution. Some studies have been undertaken to examine how marine ecosystems were rebuilt, but the response of terrestrial environments is poorly documented.  This project will examine ecological and environmental changes that occurred on land across the K/Pg boundary in the Rocky Mountain region of the western United States. The research will involve extensive paleontological and geochemical analyses of existing fossil collections and introduce novel data that will reveal the variability in the timing and pattern of terrestrial ecosystem rebuilding after the mass extinction. This project will expand knowledge of a major turning point in the history of life on Earth that will help determine how the biodiversity of ecosystems recover at the continental scale and how modern terrestrial biota evolved. The results may also provide data for conservation biologists to predict the long-term consequences of current rapid changes in biodiversity and help inform conservation priorities to alleviate ecosystem disruptions. The project will use established programs in classrooms, museum exhibits, and outreach at the participating institutions to reach audiences of multiple ages and backgrounds.<br/><br/>The K/Pg mass extinction completely changed the trajectory of the evolutionary tree of life and most research has focused on marine systems. Post-extinction patterns of ecosystem restructuring on land, fundamental to understanding the evolution of the modern taxa of mammals and plants, have received little attention because fossil collections, data, and high-resolution chronostratigraphic sections are relatively rare. This project will build on extensive fossil collections from three primary study areas in the Western Interior of North America, involve new fieldwork designed to augment collections and data from critical intervals, and develop diverse inorganic and organic geochemical records to characterize and identify biotic patterns, local environments, and factors involved in terrestrial ecosystem restructuring following the K/Pg extinction. To accomplish these goals, the research team will: collect and interpret megafloral, palynological, invertebrate, and vertebrate fossils and associated contextual data from three well-studied stratigraphic sections; use fossil leaf physiognomic traits and geochemical data from organic compounds to construct records of temperature, precipitation, and fire frequency; integrate ecological proxies of community structure and environmental conditions over time and space as they relate to the three study areas, to determine if there are any climatic conditions, geographic locations, or trophic interactions that enhance or impede ecosystem restructuring after the K/Pg extinction. In addition, geochemical proxies for volcanic activity will be examined to resolve the influence of the extensive basalt eruptions of the Deccan Traps on the biota within the study areas.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Frontier Research in Earth Sciences (FRES) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These risks can be better understood and also lessened with continuous, high-quality monitoring of volcanoes for any changes in activity or signs of imminent eruption. But these tools are logistically difficult to put in place and are expensive to maintain. This team will test if magnetic measurements can provide useful information about volcanic activity before eruption. They will also test whether the instruments needed can be built with inexpensive components. If magnetic measurements prove to be a reasonable alternative to more expensive techniques, then the capacity of civil defense authorities to prepare for volcanic eruptions will be greatly improved. The data can also be used to inform where other instruments should be placed, increasing the effectiveness of existing instrument networks. In addition to benefiting the United States, the low-cost nature of this technique could benefit other nations with high volcanic risk (Philippines, Mexico, etc.). The success of this project could bring high-quality volcanic risk-mitigation to all. All data collected as part of this project will be made publicly available as soon as possible.<br/><br/>Askja volcano?situated in Iceland?s Northern Volcanic Zone?last erupted in 1961, with a 0.7 km-long fissure opening and releasing 500 m-high lava fountains. In the intervening decades, the caldera-forming volcano has continued to deflate at a decaying rate. In August 2021, this trend rapidly reversed and Askja began to reinflate, with over 0.5 m of uplift observed at the center of inflation. Geodetic modeling of the available InSAR and GNSS positioning data has revealed a shallow sill-like magmatic source can explain the observed deformation, but the exact origin of the magma remains unclear. Modeling of a number of recent eruptions has shown that changes in the subsurface distribution of magma can produce a measurable change in the local magnetic field at the surface, but there are few to no datasets that capture such events in-situ making the modeling approach difficult to validate. In this project, a campaign network of passive magnetometers will be installed in and around Askja to capture the changes in the local magnetic field due to the continued influx of magma into the shallow crust. With these data reearchers will establish the value of such networks in volcanic systems, while also providing additional constraints for models that combine concurrent gravity surveys and continuous GNSS positioning observations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the dimensions of these matrices are usually very large, classical tools in linear algebra are inadequate to tackle this situation. One common theme of random matrix theory is that a large family of random matrices shares the same limiting distribution due to universality phenomena. This is an analogue of the central limit theorem in classical probability, where the only requirements for the i.i.d. random variables are some moment conditions. Hence, random matrix theory can make sense of large-scale data under very mild assumptions. Random matrices of large dimension can often be modeled by nonrandom operators living in some abstract operator algebras, where these operators satisfy some highly nontrivial relations characterized by Voiculescu?s free independence. These nonrandom operators are free random variables in free probability theory. The principal investigator will study probability distributions of free random variables and the convergence of suitable random matrix models. The project provides research opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students. <br/><br/>This project, supported by a LEAPS-MPS award, aims to develop analytic tools for studying fundamental questions regarding the limiting distributions of important random matrix models. These questions are motivated by questions from mathematics, statistics, combinatorics, and quantum information. The Brown measure of a free random variable is a spectral measure that generalizes the eigenvalue distribution of square matrices. One major objective is to develop new techniques for calculating Brown measures, which provide predictions for the limits of non-Hermitian random matrices. The Hermitian reduction method and subordination functions are powerful tools for deriving Brown measure formulas. The new results on Brown measures open the door to the study of random matrix models that were previously inaccessible. <br/><br/>Free probability theory offers a conceptual approach to studying random matrices of large dimensions. The principal investigator will identify the limiting free random variables for various random matrix models arising from high-dimensional statistics and quantum information theory. In particular, the principal investigator will examine the spectrum of the full rank deformed single-ring random matrix model, the autocovariance matrix of time series, and the k-positivity of random tensor networks. Additionally, the PI will explore the theory of epsilon-freeness and investigate its applications to quantum information.

Some hypotheses predict that organisms will repair tissues necessary for reproduction, while allowing other tissues to age. Other hypotheses predict the opposite: tissues related to reproduction will age faster because of selection for early life fitness. This research will examine aging dynamics across life stages and tissues, and in response to stress. Bees are an ideal system to probe the mechanistic underpinnings of extreme differences in lifespan, yielding general insight into regulators of aging. Bee life-cycles are short compared to vertebrates and its possible to examine lifetime patterns of senescence. And, many aspects of cellular senescence are conserved across insects and vertebrates. Investigating how aging dynamics differ among species may lead to new ways of disrupting negative effects of aging. Understanding aging is particularly pressing in a world in which organisms are increasingly exposed to stress and many bee species are in decline. The proposed research will support the training of six graduate students and six undergraduate students. A K-12 learning module on bumble bee spring emergence will be developed as a hands-on lesson to engage Native American high school students in STEM. As part of an ongoing collaboration, informational exhibits and outreach events about pollinators will be developed with the Red River Valley Zoo (Fargo, ND) and Science Kids and Wyoming PBS (Laramie, WY). <br/><br/>The objective of the proposed research is to integrate physiology with life history theory to mechanistically explain patterns of aging. Insect metamorphosis may be an extreme version of the disposable soma hypothesis. During metamorphosis, larval tissues are recycled and replaced by imaginal cells with stem cell-like properties, which have the potential to be cellularly ?younger? than the tissues they replace. Insect metamorphosis may provide an opportunity to dispose of damaged somatic tissues, mitigating the effects of juvenile exposure to stress. Insect overwintering, also known as diapause, also has important implications for aging. Diapause increases lifespans by six times compared to non-diapausing individuals. This research will determine how metamorphosis and diapause contribute to aging dynamics by examining cellular damage and organismal performance by: 1) determining the relationship between senescence and cellular markers of aging, 2) examining how the disposable soma during metamorphosis influences aging by comparing cellular aging in tissues formed during metamorphosis to those carried over from the larval stage, and 3) assessing whether overwintering dormancy is a slowing down of aging or is regenerative. The proposed research will investigate these dynamics in solitary bees and bumble bees, and will strengthen an already productive collaboration between NDSU, UW, and the USDA-ARS, and greatly extend what is known about the mechanisms that contribute to variation in senescence.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Integrative Ecological Physiology program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will measure the chemical characteristics of volcanic rock produced along the planet?s largest extent of mid-ocean ridge, known as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The measurements will be used to understand which components of the mantle are melting and whether volcanic activity happens continuously or in pulses. This research will aid in understanding the larger evolution of the planet, as mid-ocean ridges serve as the dominant source of new crust on the Earth. Seventy-five percent of the Earth?s magmatic activity occurs at mid-ocean ridges. This work will also help to develop an interactive exhibit at the University of Wyoming?s Geological Museum titled ?Earth?s Oceans: Now and in the Past?. This exhibit will help to inform the public, from preschoolers to senior citizens, of the importance of mid-ocean ridges in the formation and continuous resurfacing of the Earth. <br/><br/>Mid-ocean ridges offer an opportunity to understand the isotopic and lithological composition and evolution of the Earth?s mantle, the subsurface melt processes which generate basaltic magmas, and the eruptive styles and frequency which give rise to fresh oceanic crust. While the melt processes and timescales of crustal construction are well-constrained at fast-spreading mid-ocean ridges such as the East Pacific Rise, slow-spreading ridges such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge remain comparatively understudied. Furthermore, the Mid-Atlantic Ridge has been shown to erupt isotopically and geochemically enriched lavas, reflecting potentially lithologically heterogenous mantle source domains in the sub-ridge melting regime and potential nearby influences from upwelling mantle plumes. This research will constrain the mantle components which give rise to isotopically diverse oceanic crust along the 45°N segment of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the melting processes by which basaltic lavas are generated and transported to the surface, and the timescales of oceanic crustal construction that result in axial volcanic ridges. To achieve this, researchers will measure major and trace element abundances, radiogenic isotopic compositions, and U-decay series nuclides from a suite of basalt samples collected from the 45°N segment of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. In addition, tomographic imaging from beneath MAR will be constructed and coupled with the chemical and isotopic interpretations. This multi-disciplinary data set will enhance the understanding of the mantle lithologies which melt beneath the slow-spreading Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the timescales and processes of how these melts are segregated, aggregated, and transported to the surface, and the temporal progression of fresh oceanic crustal construction along slow-spreading ridge segments. This work will help to provide the scientific community with a more complete, global understanding of the nature of the Earth?s mantle and how oceanic crust is constructed.

Their unique value comes from the high-quality information they contain and the documentation indicating how they were collected.  Of particular value are trait measurements that document how species interact with each other and how they vary though time, for example, when responding to environmental changes. Unfortunately, traits for museum specimens are often only available in non-digital and non-standard formats. This limits the ability of researchers to find and use them to their full potential. This award will establish the Ranges Digitization Network (?Ranges?). The goal of the network is to digitize traits from over one million mammal specimens in 19 U.S. natural history museums. The network will produce datasets that are in standard format and easy to find in online biodiversity platforms, such as iDigBio. This will allow researchers to build better baselines for biodiversity and improve predictions of how mammals respond to changing environments. Ranges will also spark collaboration among the museum community and data scientists, creating solutions usable broadly. The network will employ a diverse human workforce in digitization and research tasks, and it will engage the public through citizen science activities and museum exhibits. This will address a major remaining digitization challenge for U.S. museums, to expand utility of specimens and use them to create new scientific knowledge. <br/><br/>Digitization of U.S. natural history museums over the past two decades has improved data sharing and research capacity in the life sciences. Among the most important data associated with museum specimens are the morphological and reproductive traits of individuals. These traits are informative about ecology, evolution, and responses of organisms to environmental change. Unfortunately, traits from specimens remain incompletely digitized across museums and hard to locate on the internet. This inhibits their discovery and use at a time of pressing global change. Ranges will digitize and publish traits from approximately 1.2 million non-marine mammal specimens from western North America. The project focuses on this region due to its complex topography and climate, and because it is a center of mammalian biodiversity. The specific goals of the network are to extend existing software tools, develop new standards for mammal trait data, and coordinate digitization across museum partners. New, digital trait data on biodiversity data platforms such as iDigBio will transform data accessibility and foster new evolutionary, ecological, and biomedical research. Ranges will also collaborate with the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) to ensure compatibility with trait data collected throughout the lifetime of that network. Using the above approaches, Ranges will lay a foundation for building an extended specimen network for mammals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A species' geographic distribution refers to the places where populations of that species can be found. The edge of a species' distribution is its geographic range boundary - the species can be found within this boundary, but not outside of it. Although all species have boundaries, the underlying mechanisms determining where and how they form remain poorly understood for two key reasons. First, some of the hypothesized mechanisms are difficult to manipulate in natural settings. Second, researchers have historically approached this problem from either an ecological or evolutionary perspective which can be difficult to merge. Here, the researchers will use a combination of computation models and laboratory experiments on flour beetles growing in artificial landscapes to test multiple hypotheses behind the factors that determine species' geographic distributions. A better understanding of the factors that determine range limits will be crucial for improved management of invasive and endangered species and for predicting how species will change their ranges in response to climate change. In addition to potential insights into pressing conservation concerns, the researchers will actively engage the public through interactive activities at local farmers? markets to teach the public, particularly children, about the importance of ecology and evolution in natural populations and agriculture.<br/><br/>The researchers will use microcosms of the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, a common agricultural pest species, to manipulate the rate of change in environmental conditions, the level of dispersal, and the presence of an ecological competitor. These factors will be systematically varied to test each of their direct and interacting effects on the formation and location of range limits. Further, the researchers will use single patch controls to test for adaptation to different environmental conditions in the absence of dispersal from populations in other environmental conditions. DNA of beetles from the microcosm landscapes and the single patch controls will be sequenced to identify the genomic basis of adaptation and quantify the amount of genetic drift at the range edges. These experimental results will be combined with genetically explicit simulation models to test additional parameter values not tested in the mesocosm experiments. Overall, the project will provide critical data testing how environmental gradients and interspecific interactions interact with dispersal, adaptation, and genetic drift to affect range limits.

Planetary albedo is a composite quantity determined by the reflection of sunlight from the relatively dark and thus low albedo ocean surface, lighter and thus higher albedo land surfaces, and the even higher albedos of snow and ice covered surfaces.  Clouds add another layer of complexity as bright reflective clouds form intermittently over darker land and ocean.  The complexity of planetary albedo is a challenge for efforts to determine the warming effect of greenhouse gas (GHG) increases since warming can cause a decrease in albedo, say due to the replacement of high-albedo sea ice with lower albedo ocean surface, which in turn can substantially enhance the GHG warming.<br/><br/>Recent work shows that the albedos of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres are uncannily close: the sunlight received in each hemisphere is the same averaged over the year, and the amount reflected back to space is 99.7 watts per square meter in the Southern Hemisphere and 99.6 in the Northern Hemisphere (the resulting planetary albedo is about 29%).  The sameness occurs despite the higher albedo of the Northern Hemisphere due to its larger land area, which yields a difference in hemispheric reflected sunlight of about 6 watts per square meter under clear skies. This difference must be compensated by clouds, and the work of Datseris and Stevens (2021) shows that the compensation is largely occurring over the middle- and high-latitude oceans, as the Southern Ocean is cloudier than the northern Pacific and Atlantic by about 11%.  Datseris and Stevens also show that while planetary albedo has decreased appreciably over the past two decades the Northern and Southern Hemispheres have seen equivalent reductions, thereby retaining their ""albedo symmetry"".  There is no theory for why clouds should compensate for surface albedo differences, and it is of course possible that the albedo symmetry of the recent record is a coincidence and not the result of a global-scale adjustment mechanism.<br/><br/>Work under this award seeks to determine if an adjustment mechanism exists and if so to develop a theory for it.  In addition to observational data from satellite missions and reanalysis products the work takes advantage of large ensembles of model simulations including simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project and a recent perturbed physics ensemble (PPE) created using the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM, the atmospheric component model of CESM, the Community Earth System Model).  Results from analysis of these models are used to design additional simulations created with CAM, CESM, and a simplified version of CESM in which the ocean component model is replaced by a thermodynamic ""slab"" which simulates ocean heat storage but not ocean circulation. The work is of societal as well as scientific interest given the potentially large role that albedo changes could play in determining how much warming is caused by a given increase in GHG concentrations. A theory of albedo adjustment operating through cloud processes and on a global basis could provide valuable guidance in anticipating the magnitude of future climate change.  The project also provides support and training for two graduate students, thereby providing for the future scientific work force in this research area.  Undergraduate students are also involved in the project as summer interns.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Only a fraction of the ca. 4,000 known bee species in the United States have adequate data for assessing their presence or absence in an ecosystem. The iDigBees Thematic Collections Network addresses this problem by transcribing specimen label information for thousands of bee specimens in US insect collections into a shared global database. As a result, bees will become the first major insect group to have specimen data sufficiently digitized to promote research projects and support conservation efforts. Specifically, the iDigBees project will (1) map distributions for thousands of bee species and quantify patterns of bee biodiversity; (2) identify data gaps to inform future inventory and monitoring efforts; (3) reveal changes in species distributions over time through historic records; (4) document the impacts of a changing climate on bees; (5) identify critical taxa and geographic areas for conservation; and (6) establish a network of researchers, conservationists, and land managers to rapidly utilize data for research, education, public policy, and land management. The education program will coordinate an array of existing programs and create a new technology-mediated learning tool, SMARTBees, to serve high school and college students. Obtaining specimen-level data on US bee species and communities, and integrating findings into education programs, are essential steps toward addressing the pollinator crisis.<br/><br/>iDigBees represents an in-depth insect biodiversity digitization initiative that will mobilize at least 350,000 bee specimen records, and 6,600 high-resolution image suites.

As one of sub-Saharan Africa?s most prolific inland fisheries, a healthy Lake Tanganyika is critically important to the nutrition of four developing nations. If global warming alters internal processes that affect the fish production in Lake Tanganyika, then the food security for millions of people will suffer. Moreover, the impacts of climate change on the characteristics of different groups making up Lake Tanganyika?s open water and lake floor communities, as well as interactions among these groups, are unknown. This project aims to study the response of Lake Tanganyika?s food web to several different scenarios of climate change using sediments, fossils, and genetic tools. The results of the project will reveal how aquatic organisms, particularly economically valuable fish, respond to changes in temperature and precipitation within large tropical lakes. With this information, fisheries and ecosystem managers will be better equipped to safeguard food resources and biodiversity in their areas of responsibility. Finally, this project will include strong international partnership to train students, conduct workshops and develop materials for public audiences.<br/><br/>This project will use Lake Tanganyika?s high-resolution sedimentary record to set up a series of historical experiments to track functional biodiversity lake-wide. This framework integrates geochemical, fossil, and genomic tools to assess open water and bottom-dwelling community structures and functions under different scenarios of climate change, as well as the physical and physiological responses of key organisms to these changes. Because the hydroclimatic conditions of the Holocene are underrepresented in historical data, this approach provides the opportunity to evaluate the consequences of environmental change for Lake Tanganyika?s food web in a way that was previously impossible to know. In addition, the project will identify shared and divergent responses to climatic fluctuations across the lake?s diverse fauna, and link these responses to trait-based understanding of community assembly and functioning.

Certain MPEAs have demonstrated superior mechanical properties (e.g., hardness, strength) unattainable from traditional alloys, making them ideal for high temperature applications (e.g., gas turbine blades and surface coatings for reentry vehicles). Incidentally, degradation by oxidation is a critical material challenge that must still be overcome to improve performance in such applications. Due to the complex compositional combinations, making oxidation resistant MPEAs is nontrivial. In this project, composition-processing-structure-property relationships for oxidation-resistant MPEAs are established through state-of-the-art experimental characterizations and computer simulations, guided by an artificial intelligence (AI) assisted innovative data-adaptive discovery strategy. Fundamentally, the oxidation mechanism¬ from the atomic to micro-meter scale is studied through both experimental discovery and machine learning embedded within a materials design and surface engineering framework. The results of this project enable an advanced materials paradigm for the discovery and creation of oxidation resistant MPEAs applicable for high temperature operations. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>Multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) are concentrated random solid-solutions typically consisting of five or more elements in significant proportions. While the remarkable mechanical properties (e.g., hardness, or strength) of certain MPEAs have encouraged their potential use for components operating at high temperatures such as those found in gas turbine blades or surface coatings for reentry vehicles. At the operation conditions for such components, degradation by oxidation remains a critical materials challenge. Consequently, during synthesis of oxidation resistant MPEAs, the versatility in elemental compositions for these complex alloys translates to an extensive range of possible oxidation products, many with poor resistance to the penetration of oxygen into the bulk alloy. To address this challenge and explore the associated enormous composition-processing-structure-property landscape, the oxidation mechanism¬ from atomic scale oxygen chemisorption to micro-meter oxide scale formation are studied by an innovative and experimentally validated data-guided adaptive approach. A surface engineering paradigm for the synthesis and processing of MPEAs with improved oxidation resistance are being developed. Central to the proposed framework are four research developments: (1) MPEA Concept Exploration; (2) Surface Engineering & Atomic Characterization; (3) Density Functional Theory Calculations; and (4) Adaptive Discovery. The results of this research are expected to have significant economic impact on society through innovations in surface-engineered MPEAs across a wide range of industries such as energy, hypersonic applications, defense and healthcare. This timely research lies within the domains of fundamental materials physics, predictive synthesis, and data science and offers unique collaborative and interdisciplinary research and training experiences for researchers across the fields of surface physics, material science, data analytics, and computational materials. Research is integrated with education through cross-university teaching and assessment, exchange-visits and co-advised student training coupled with technology innovation and entrepreneurial experiences. In this project, PIs also actively engage with programs for pre-college women and underrepresented minority students to encourage them to pursue STEM careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Core mathematical epidemiological models have provided useful insight about pandemic risks, but typically do not account for the wide variety of people?s responses to the risk from the disease and the ways these responses shape ongoing transmission. Behavior affects disease spread: nature affects people, and people affect nature?connecting the natural and human systems in feedback loops that determine the course of outbreaks. The multi-disciplinary research team will bridge disciplines, toolkits, and data to advance knowledge about these feedbacks between human behaviors and infectious disease outcomes. The PIs will extend mathematical epidemiological models by including heterogeneity in behavioral responses to risks and social norms (e.g., mask/vaccines acceptance) involving feedback from both aggregate public health outcomes and the diverse responses from individuals. The models will be informed by data from three countries with unique characteristics representing health risks, public policies, information sources, and government trust: the United States, Norway, and Sweden. Real-world data will be supplemented by data collected in controlled settings?through surveys and behavioral laboratory experiments?to gain a deeper understanding of the individual factors and social processes that shape people?s responses to epidemic risks. The project will improve the abilities of epidemiological models to predict both disease outcomes and the economic impacts of public health regulations or guidelines, enhancing the capacity of public policy-makers to design and evaluate epidemic control measures during future outbreaks.<br/><br/>This project will develop and estimate behavioral reaction functions that can be included in systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that comprise most epi-models, with the goal of better informing policy design during novel epidemics. The PIs will focus on two overarching research questions: Q1 How do people?s behavioral reactions influence the evolution of an infectious disease outbreak through feedbacks on pathogen spread? and Q2 How are people?s behaviors during an outbreak moderated by the pronounced uncertainties and frequent policy changes that are characteristic of novel epidemics? To address these questions, the PIs will: (i) develop a new epidemiological-behavioral system of coupled ODEs, (ii) use observational, survey, and experimental data and methods to estimate people?s reactions to epidemic risks and top-down control policies, (iii) integrate our empirical findings into our new epi-model, and (iv) use their parameterized epi-model to conduct retrospective and prospective policy simulations and comparisons. In addition, the PIs will use observational data from three developed countries that undertook distinct policy approaches to the on-going COVID-19 pandemic: the United States, Norway, and Sweden. Moreover, the PIS will design surveys and behavioral laboratory experiments to gain a deeper understanding of responses to risk in contexts that are similar to novel epidemics.

The growth of metals on oxide surfaces is of interest to a number of technological applications including heterogeneous catalysis, electronic devices, and gas sensing. Surface structures of CeO2 influence the physical and chemical properties of deposited metals, leading to unique applications such as active and robust catalysts, sensors, and electronic/magnetic materials. Drs. Zhou and Xu and their students are investigating the detailed role that ceria plays in controlling the nucleation, size, and structure of supported Ni and Co nano-clusters. Graduate, undergraduate, and high school students involved in this research will be prepared for future careers at the intersection of nanoscience, chemistry, materials science, and computational modeling.<br/><br/>Active metals such as Ni and Co supported on reducible ceria can exhibit distinct chemical behavior owing to the unique redox properties and oxygen storage capacity of ceria as well as strong metal-support interaction. Surface structures including oxygen vacancies, step edges, and terraces on CeO2 can affect the oxidation state, size, structure, distribution, and density of Ni and Co ad-clusters and alter their reactivity and stability. The project involves preparing model CeO2 single crystal surfaces with controlled structures, using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) with in situ characterization capabilities to examine the deposition of Ni and Co metals and the growth mechanisms of Ni and Co nano-clusters on the CeO2 surface with respect to specific support structures, and using theoretical methods to aid and enhance the interpretation of the experimental STM results.

The bacterial species that will be used to make TAG, called Rhodococuus opacus, is particularly good at converting the energy in woody and fibrous plant matter (i.e. lignocellulosic feedstocks) into other molecules. However, a challenge is that the optimal conditions for TAG synthesis are not conducive to cell growth, thus production is self-limiting. This project seeks to solve this problem by transforming Rhodococcus strains into multicellular systems, where the tasks of population growth and TAG production are assigned to different cell types. If the strains produce more TAG, they could be used to increase the efficiency of U.S. agriculture by transforming wasted plant material into useful fuel. This project also contributes to undergraduate biosciences education through the development of augmented reality-based classroom technology. Here, holographic three-dimensional video imagery is used in combination with pass- through visualization to create a vibrant and highly interactive social learning environment. Within shared, augmented reality learning spaces, students collaborate in small teams to enhance learning through lessons in enzyme pathways and enzyme kinetics.<br/><br/>The technological approach centers on the idea of enhancing Rhodococcus by inserting a genetically engineered system that enables two independently programmable cell types. With independently controllable cell types, it is possible to carry out mutually antagonistic tasks simultaneously. In this project, the two mutually antagonistic tasks are high-level triacylglycerol (TAG) production, which requires that cells undergo nitrogen deprivation and stop dividing, and population growth, which requires nitrogen. For maximal production, one cell type, called a ?factory cell?, is programmed to stop incorporating nitrogen and expend all available metabolic resources to make TAG. The other cell type, called a ?stem cell?, is programmed to import nitrogen and divide asymmetrically. After each stem cell division, one daughter retains stem cell fate while the other furthers TAG production by differentiating into a factory cell. The continual generation of healthy new factory cells from the dividing stem cell population is expected to prolong TAG synthesis and lead to higher overall yield.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Genetics and molecular biological approaches made significant progress in the identification of the host-resistant protein. However, characterization of effector proteins secreted from the fungi, which facilitate the pathogenesis process and are recognized by host resistant proteins, remain elusive. This research will elucidate an important defense mechanism in maize, a model species for plant quantitative genetics and the number one crop in the U.S., using complementary approaches, including bioinformatics, functional genomics, and advanced cell biological methods. Since the hypersensitive response is a general defense response found in all multicellular plants, this finding will be relevant to improving other important crop species, particularly other grasses. Graduate, undergraduate, and high school students will be trained in the fundamental understanding of crop research and cutting-edge methods on cell biology, biochemistry, and molecular genetics in plant-microbe interaction at the University of Wyoming and North Carolina State University. Students will participate in this project as part-time student researchers and more intensively during summer via the summer research program. Additional outreach activities are planned with the NCSU Science House to educate the public on genetics, plant breeding, biotechnology, and associated societal implications.<br/><br/>The project employs Nicotiana benthamiana as a model to elucidate the molecular and cellular basis of fungal pathogen Puccinia sorghi and maize interaction. The maize Rp1-D gene encodes an NLR resistance protein that confers resistance to common rust disease caused by the fungus Puccinia sorghi. Molecular genetic studies using an auto-active derivative of the Rp1-D gene identify several host regulatory components. However, pathogen effector protein recognized by Rp1-D triggering hypersensitive responsive programmed cell death (HR-PCD) is elusive to date. This research will 1) identify effectors associated with the control of host cell death and suppression of the host defense response, 2) define how these effectors influence essential physiological changes in host cells, such as changes in pH, reactive oxygen species production, and calcium flux, and their subcellular localizations, and 3) examine the maize HR regarding these physiological changes and organelle dynamics, such as stromule formation and inter-organellar communication in the cell. Ultimately, this research will characterize the physical interactions of all the host- and pathogen-derived components that interact with Rp1-D and are likely to constitute cellular components of the Rp1-D mediated immune signaling complex. This will result in an understanding of the control of the NLR-mediated response that is unique in maize and among the most detailed in any plant species.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These circuits give rise to our perceptions, thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. Understanding how neurons self-assemble into circuits is an important aim in the field of neuroscience, and it is the overall aim of this project. This would be difficult to study in mammals with their billions of neurons, complex circuits, and variable behaviors. This project studies a more experimentally tractable circuit: the developing visual system of the African Clawed Frog (Xenopus) tadpole. Previous studies on the tadpole visual system have focused on the retinotectal projection, a circuit consisting of the synapse between the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the eye and the optic tectum, a major visual processing center on the dorsal (top) surface of the amphibian midbrain. In preparatory work for the current project, we characterized a second projection between the retinal ganglion cells from the Xenopus eye and the ventral (bottom) midbrain called the retinotegmental projection. Preliminary data indicate that these two projections are built differently and carry out different functions within the visual system. The goal of this project is to provide a detailed description of the development and function of the retinotegmental projection. Overall, this work will contribute important new insights about how neural circuits form and carry out specific functions. Educational and broader impact activities for this project include teaching a ?Vision and Art? course for non-science undergraduates, and an upper-level developmental science lab course in which students design and carry out experiments to determine how environmental factors impact the developing Xenopus embryo. <br/><br/>How neurons self-assemble into circuits that give rise to behaviors is a fundamental question in neuroscience. For decades, the Xenopus tadpole retinotectal projection ? the synapse between the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the eye and the midbrain optic tectum ? has served as a popular model to study this question. But the retinotectal projection is only one of several components of the vertebrate visual system. Our recent work shows that color-dependent phototaxis in tadpoles does not require the optic tectum, but does require the tegmentum, a region of the midbrain that lies ventral to the optic tectum. We also found several color-tuned neuronal populations in the tegmentum. Through additional anatomical and electrophysiological studies, we identified a retinotegmental projection, a direct projection from the RGCs to the midbrain tegmental neurons. This projection appears to lack the developmental plasticity displayed by the retinotectal projection, suggesting a more hard-wired circuit. A highly conserved retinotegmental projection, termed the accessory optic system (AOS), has been described across a wide range of adult vertebrates, from frogs to humans. It is associated with optomotor and optokinetic responses ? reflexive body and eye movements, respectively, that stabilize vision as the organism moves through space. It is likely that the retinotegmental projection we are studying in the tadpole is, at least in part, the AOS. Through a combination of electrophysiology-based approaches and circuit tracing, this work will provide a detailed description of the development and differentiation of the Xenopus tadpole retinotegmental projection and its role in processing visual stimuli.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the specific processes that alter soil characteristics to increase flooding and erosion are not well understood. Soil sealing is one of the less studied post-wildfire processes because the peak impact of soil sealing occurs immediately after a wildfire when it can be difficult and dangerous to make field observations. However, this time period immediately after a wildfire also holds the highest risk for high damage flooding due to the lack of vegetation. To investigate the soil sealing processes that occur immediately after a wildfire, the investigators in this project will conduct laboratory experiments to simulate rainfall on burned soils and ash materials. The outcomes will provide new information about post-wildfire soil sealing processes with implications for forest management and disaster mitigation. Additionally, this project will support the development of technical skills for four college students and the development of a 4th and 5th grade science lesson on soil erosion.<br/><br/>The overarching research question of this project is: how does the slope angle of a land surface affect soil sealing processes immediately after a wildfire, and how does this impact infiltration for consequent rain events? As slope angle increases, surface ash erosion rates will increase. As a result, it is hypothesized that soil surfaces that experience increased storage of ash will promote soil sealing processes that decrease infiltration during later rain events, thereby increasing runoff. To test this hypothesis, laboratory scale rainfall simulations will be conducted at a range of slope angles on simulated burned soil conditions. Investigators will observe the effect of slope angle by (1) quantifying the effect of slope angle on surface ash erosion and surface storage through rainfall experiments, and (2) determining the effect of ash retention, if any, on soil properties after rainfall experiments. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Hydrologic Sciences and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These interactions are being disrupted around the globe due to human activities, and such disruptions can have cascading effects on communities, ecosystems, and human well-being. In groups of interacting species, as examined in this study, species may vary in their roles in the community: the loss of some species can have large impacts on the community, while the loss of others may have little to no effect. Determining which species to target for conservation requires understanding the roles that species play, the importance of behavior in maintaining species interactions, and how loss of particular species alters the community. Yet, these questions have received little attention. Further, insight into how interactions may vary in response to changing environments can be gained from examining if, how, and why the loss of different types of species alters or disrupts species interactions. This project will include training of underrepresented early career scientists and an undergraduate field-based course in Panama, supported by team-wide training in mentoring to increase equity and inclusivity. The team will also develop open educational research modules for use at the undergraduate level across multiple universities.<br/><br/>To examine species interactions and the links between behavior and community ecology, researchers will study one type of mixed-species animal group, army-ant-following birds, using a well-replicated network analytic and experimental approach in tropical forests. The team will test a recently proposed theoretical framework for understanding mixed-species animal group organization, and will greatly expand upon this framework by adding new behavioral roles, context-dependency in roles, and evaluating linkages between behaviors, net benefits, and group structure. In particular, this study will evaluate the behavioral roles of species within these groups, whether roles vary across contexts, and whether temporary loss of a species with differing roles alters (1) the structure of the group during the formation stage (when the group is first forming), and (2) the behaviors, net benefits of interacting, and structure during the maintenance stage (after they have formed). This will be done by conducting two experiments - an acoustic species removal experiment during the formation stage and a physical species removal experiment during the maintenance stage. In each experiment, species with differing behavioral roles will be removed. Behavioral observations will be conducted to assess the impacts of species loss on recruitment, foraging, competition, and group structure. The project will uniquely bridge the fields of animal behavior and community ecology by examining the underlying behavioral mechanisms altering group structure and community resistance, and do so by conducting novel, experimental field tests of how networks respond to species loss.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

LIBs are the most used power source for electric vehicles, which leads to an ever-increasing need to improve the safety of LIBs so that they can be used in mechanical abuse conditions. To improve the safety design and ultimately reliability of advanced long life and high energy LIBs, a recent trend is to use numerical simulations as an alternative to expensive and time-consuming real-world testing for LIB response prediction under mechanical abuse conditions. However, due to the multiscale nature of LIBs and the nonlinear response of LIB components, it is computationally expensive to directly model the LIBs by accounting for the complex microstructures and nonlinear responses of different LIB components. To address this issue, the PIs plan to develop a multiscale modeling framework that better balances accuracy and efficiency for LIB modeling. The characterization and testing of LIB components at different loading conditions are also planned, which will facilitate the model development and eventually validate the computational framework. The  research will also be complemented by establishing a responsive and flexible educational and outreach program based on curriculum development and summer research programs for undergraduate and high-school students with an engineering focus, as well as K-12 and underrepresented minority outreach through STEM education centers at both participating institutes.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to develop an integrated multiscale reduced-order modeling and experimental framework for LIBs under mechanical abuse conditions by integrating physics­-based constitutive models for LIB components with a multiscale reduced order modeling technique. To achieve this goal, the research encompasses the following three aims and plans: 1) Determine the constitutive models of battery components with full coverage of low, intermediate, and high strain rates; 2) Develop a multiscale reduced-order computational model to predict the response of LIB cells by advancing the eigendeformation-based reduced ­order homogenization model (EHM); 3) Conduct dynamic testing of battery cells to validate the developed multiscale models and exercise the validated model for LIB design and safety evaluation. The multiscale modeling framework will achieve reakthroughs in designing optimal LIB systems, which will expand the conventional boundaries of LIB performance.

About 90% of ice sheet is covered by compacted snow that is slowly transitioning into glacier ice. This aged and dense snow is called ?firn? and forms a porous layer that is many tens of meters thick. Much of the meltwater generated from the surface of the firn layer infiltrates into the underlying open pore space of the firn and refreezes. However, as this porous layer absorbs more melt it becomes warmer, denser, and filled with ice layers, which reduces its ability to absorb additional melt. Therefore, the thermal and structural transformation that Greenland's firn layer is presently undergoing has important implications for the ice sheet's capacity to retain future melt. This project is directly observing firn evolution with a network of instruments installed within the firn layer and with ice cores sampling the firn. The observational data collected by this project provides on-the-ground documentation of firn conditions needed to develop and test models and remote sensing tools for large-scale investigations of changes to the Greenland ice sheet. Future transformation of the firn layer will govern how much surface melt is retained locally on the ice sheet and how much runs off, thereby impacting hydrologic conditions of the ice sheet and surrounding regions, ocean salinity, and sea level rise.<br/><br/>The researchers will install and maintain an observation network along a transect of the Greenland ice sheet to directly measure the state and transformation of firn properties. Repeat sampling of firn cores and instrumentation extending from the surface to 25 meters depth will yield the observational datasets needed by multiple scientific communities: firn temperature, density and ice content, densification rate, surface boundary processes (radiation, snow accumulation, temperature), and ice velocity. The network will yield 4-5 full-year records in this five-year Arctic Observing Network project. The project will provide comprehensive datasets for process-level investigations, testing climate model simulations of firn processes, and interpreting satellite-based measurement of surface elevation change.

To ensure that services remain sustainable, land managers allocate limited resources to alleviate evolving stressors between society and the environment; however, land management decisions are challenged by scientific limitations and inadequate communication among scientists, decision-makers, and the public. This project aims to inform land management decisions by identifying regions that provide stable ecosystem services despite climate change and other human-caused disturbance. The project team ? representing climate science, geology, hydrology, social science, and ecology ? includes students from a Hispanic-Serving Institution and community colleges. The team will work with decision-makers to develop measurement and prediction technologies to estimate where, how, and when ecosystems may experience irreversible change this century.

This is predicted to result in half of the population facing freshwater shortages by 2030.  Because only about 3% of all water on Earth is suitable for human consumption and the oceans contain 97% of the Earth?s water, energy-efficient desalinization (salt separation) technologies are crucial for maintaining society?s quality of life. Reverse osmosis (RO) is currently the most employed and reliable method for water desalinization; however, improvements in process efficiency are needed to make it a more sustainable treatment option. These improvements center on the physical and chemical characteristics of the membrane materials and membrane modules to address issues related to salt selectivity, water permeability, and chemical tolerance. This project will produce new generations of membrane materials that could possibly be more stable, selective, and energy-efficient than current RO membranes. Moreover, these materials and systems have the potential to be modified for other water purification applications such as the removal of specific contaminants.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The new membrane materials will be based on two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D-COFs), 2D polymers with a defined but modifiable pore structure, which can be synthesized with a high degree of order. Furthermore, the effort will develop synthetic strategies for putting a wide variety of functional groups in the pores. The 2D flake-like nature of the materials make them naturally suited for semipermeable membrane applications. The focus of the project will be on placing charged functional groups in the pores and changing the pore sizes to make ion-selective membranes that reject either anions or cations with a specific size threshold. The interdisciplinary team associated with this project consists of a synthetic organic chemist, an electrochemist/materials scientist, a membrane engineering specialist, and a computational scientist. Thus, the project will use a feedback loop between the organic synthesis of the membrane, membrane performance testing, and computational modeling and machine learning to guide the syntheses of the new membrane materials and optimize their performance for a particular separation. When this is combined with the input and actions of the industrial partner on the effort, this project will take a Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) approach to research such that materials discovery and deployment is accelerated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, not all colonies in a certain area decline or disappear at the same rate. This research project will evaluate the influence of terrestrial surface properties on Adélie penguin colonies, leveraging five decades of research on seabirds near Palmer Station where an Adélie colony on Litchfield Island became extinct in 2007 while other colonies nearby are still present. The researchers will combine information obtained from remote sensing, UAS (Unoccupied Aircraft System, or drones) high-resolution maps, reconstruction of past moss banks and modeling with machine learning tools to define suitable penguin and peatbank moss habitats and explore the influence of microclimate on their distributions. In particular, the researchers are asking if guano from penguin colonies could act as fertilizers of moss banks in the presence of localized wind patters that can carry airborne nitrogen to the mosses. Modeling will relate penguin and peatbank moss spatial patterns to environmental variables and provide a greater understanding of how continued environmental change could impact these communities. The project allows for documentation of terrestrial Antarctic ecosystems in support of seabirds and provisioning of such information to the broader science community that seeks to study penguins, educating graduate and undergraduate students and a post-doctoral researcher. The research team includes two young women as Principal Investigators, one of them from an under-represented ethnic minority, first time Antarctic Principal Investigator, from an EPSCoR state (Wyoming), broadening participation in Antarctic research.

By integrating in situ and remote data, this project will synthesize the drivers of biogeomorphology on small islands of the Antarctic Peninsula, a region of rapid change where plants and animals often co-occur and animal presence often determines the habitation of plants. A multi-disciplinary approach combine field measurements, remote sensing, UAS (Unoccupied Aircraft Systems) maps, paleoecology and modeling with machine learning to define suitable habitats and the influence of microclimates on penguin and peatbank distributions. The link between the two aspects of this study, peatbanks and penguins, is the potential source of nutrients for peat mosses from penguin guano. Peatbank and penguin distribution will be modeled and all models will be validated using in situ information from moss samples that will identify mechanistic processes. This project leverages 5 decades of seabird research in the area and high-definition remote sensing provided by the Polar Geospatial center to study the microclimate of Litchfield Island where an Adélie colony became extinct in 2007 when other colonies nearby are still present.

The project also increases access to leadership opportunities for individuals traditionally underrepresented in archaeology. Two members of project leadership are women and one is an underrepresented in science doctoral student. This research not only trains graduate students in the field but will be integrated into undergraduate courses including the ?Origins of the State? where students will better understand the linkages between complex societies, emergent inequalities, and inequity, as well as the critical role played by archaeology in illuminating these issues. <br/> <br/>This multidisciplinary and multinational team will investigate inequality through the detailed, comparative excavation and analysis of ancient households, storage features, and mortuary contexts dating to multiple time periods. Large samples of households, storage features, and burials will be excavated, and comparative statistical analysis (Gini coefficients) will be applied to variables linked to inequality, such as, for example, house size and complexity. The Gini coefficient is a numerical measure of the unequal concentration of some measured variable within a community or among communities in a society and is used by economists to measure inequality in contemporary societies. These large archaeological datasets and their Gini coefficients allows the team to empirically measure inequality through time. This kind of large-scale statistical analysis provides an important case study to the understanding of inequality worldwide from the human past. The investigation challenges common impressions that once established, inequality is unchanging and inevitable.

Remarkably, a common strategy that has evolved to help organisms across all kingdoms of life deal with desiccation is through the synthesis of a special class of proteins known as intrinsically disordered proteins. Despite their importance in protecting animals and plants from drying out, how these proteins work is unresolved. This project will combine experiments that span individual molecules to whole organisms to understand how disordered proteins provide protection from dehydration across all kingdoms of life. As part of this study, this project will recruit students from rural communities via remote-learning and include them in cutting edge, interdisciplinary research which will facilitate their integration into the US STEM workforce. <br/><br/>Proteomes across all kingdoms of life contain a significant fraction of sequences that are intrinsically disordered and do not adopt a stable three-dimensional structure. Instead, these sequences exist in an ensemble of rapidly interconverting conformations that can be highly sensitive to changes in the cellular environment in which they function. Interestingly, many of these disordered proteins are implicated in mediating resistance to environmental stresses, including desiccation, in which the physical-chemical composition of the cell changes dramatically. The goal of this project is to gain a holistic understanding of how disordered proteins and the cellular environment come together to provide protection to the cell during extreme desiccation. Towards this goal, the project will employ a multilevel, interdisciplinary, and integrated approach. Starting at the molecular level, in vitro and computational experiments will be performed that will provide insight into how desiccation-protective disordered proteins function in conjunction with well defined and controllable environments. This information will be integrated with high throughput, sequencing-based studies of disordered protein-mediated desiccation protection performed in yeast (cellular level), and a multicellular animal model (the roundworm, Caenorhabditis elegans, organismal level).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The rare earth elements (REEs) are important components in many facets of our day-to-day life, for example, in permanent magnets, many electronics, and batteries in hybrid cars. Platinum group elements (PGEs) are important components in catalytic agents and are utilized in many industrial and electronic applications. Despite critical element enrichment in many alkaline magmatic systems, our understanding of the igneous processes that influence their enrichment and distribution is limited. A better understanding of the igneous processes that control critical element concentrations in alkaline systems can aid in informing focused critical element exploration. This project aims to evaluate igneous processes that may influence the enrichment and distribution of PGEs and REEs within the alkaline magmatic system at the Rattlesnake Hills Alkaline Complex, Wyoming. Broader impacts of this project include graduate student training, research experience for undergraduate students, and the development of 3D rock models and associated assignments for distribution to educators. This project is jointly funded by the Petrology and Geochemistry program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>Alkaline systems show extreme variation in critical element enrichment (e.g., REEs, PGEs, Te, V, W, Ba, and F) and Au contents. The proposed project will evaluate potential controls on critical element enrichment at the Rattlesnake Hills alkaline complex (RHAC). End-member hypotheses for critical element enrichment include: 1) country rock control, potentially as crustal assimilation or hydrothermal scavenging and redistribution of critical elements from country rock, 2) liquid immiscibility, and 3) initial composition of alkaline magmas. The project will document the igneous history of the RHAC, distinguishing timing and sources of igneous units and their relationship to mineralization. Geochemical and isotopic data will be collected to evaluate the input of critical elements from country rock. The role of liquid immiscibility will be investigated through the use of geochemical and melt inclusion data. Despite recognition of economic enrichment in alkaline systems for over 100 years, the processes that control critical element enrichment within these deposits are unclear. Understanding these controls will better elucidate the evolution of shallowly-emplaced, mantle-derived melts, the cycling of critical minerals in the upper-crust, and inform targeted exploration for critical minerals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Anderson and his group at the University of Wyoming are using extremely cold crystals made from molecular hydrogen as a reaction vessel to investigate chemistry at low temperatures. The first thrust of the research project examines the diffusion and reactivity of hydrogen atoms.  At extremely low temperatures (-457°F), hydrogen atoms are better described as matter waves instead of particles, which has a major impact on how they diffuse through the crystal and react chemically with other species.  Chemistry is transformed under these low-temperature conditions into the fully quantum mechanical regime where unexpected chemical behavior can be discovered.  The second thrust of the work involves experimental studies of nuclear spin states in polyatomic molecules that undergo rapid cooling, photochemistry, or chemical reactions. Nuclear spin refers to the internal state of an atom, and sometimes has an orientation.  Certain molecules, like water, come in two different forms, one where the two hydrogen atoms have their nuclear spins aligned in the same direction, and the other with the two hydrogen atom spins aligned in opposite directions.  These different nuclear spin isomers of water have different magnetic properties.  The research team led by Professor Anderson is examining to what extent nuclear spin is conserved during various physical and chemical processes, with the goal of learning how to use nuclear spin to control chemical reactions and to enhance magnetic imaging techniques.  <br/><br/>This experimental work uses a custom-designed cryogenic apparatus to synthesize cryocrystals of para-hydrogen (a specific nuclear spin isomer of molecular hydrogen) doped with parts per million concentrations of chemical impurities at temperatures in the 1.5 to 5 K range.  Hydrogen atoms are created in situ using a variety of ultraviolet light sources and the ensuing reaction kinetics are measured using high-resolution Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy.  Professor Anderson and his group utilize a liquid helium cryostat to achieve such low temperatures and have built a dedicated helium recovery system to recycle the spent helium gas to minimize supply costs.  The students working with Professor Anderson gain experience using sophisticated methods in experimental physical chemistry that probe the physical and chemical properties of quantum materials, materials whose properties are dominated by the laws of quantum mechanics. The involvement of students in the research has a significant impact by training future scientists in the techniques of low-temperature chemistry and the quantum-mechanical manipulation of matter.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many volcanoes that pose great risks to large populations are well studied and highly monitored with scientific instruments, but there is still a fundamental lack of understanding of many basic aspects of the Nyiragongo and Nyamulagira systems. This investigation will improve our understanding of these systems by focusing on (1) how magma forms beneath the two volcanoes, (2) how deeply and for how long magma is stored beneath the volcanoes before eruption, (3) what triggers eruptions to occur on the flanks of the volcanoes, in and near populated areas, and (4) how fast magma moves towards the surface during an eruption and how much warning time people would have in advance of an eruption. In addition to these aspects focused on hazards, this project will investigate the source of the carbon that is released as carbon dioxide by these volcanoes. Large amounts of carbon are likely stored in solid minerals inside the Earth beneath thick, old continental crust like that in East Africa, and when the crust gets pulled apart by rifting as in the East African Rift, the carbon contributes to magma formation. Nyiragongo is one of the largest emitters of carbon dioxide gas of any volcano worldwide, and better understanding the connection between carbon in minerals and magma formation beneath this volcano will help us better understand the Earth?s deep carbon cycle. Much of the research for this project will be conducted by graduate students at the University of Oregon and University of Wyoming as part of their scientific training. Collaboration with scientists at the Goma Volcano Observatory in the Democratic Republic of the Congo will include periodic videoconferences to share research results important for volcanic hazards monitoring. Public engagement will include a National Geographic Explorer?s Blog and several short articles for a general audience on volcanic hazards at Nyiragongo and Nyamulagira and release of carbon dioxide from volcanoes.<br/><br/>In detail, the primary goals of this project are (1) to understand the time-integrated effects of lithospheric metasomatism on magma generation beneath Nyiragongo and Nyamulagira, and (2) to use the results as the starting point for a source-to-surface investigation of the plumbing systems, magma storage timescales, eruption triggering processes, and magma ascent rates for these volcanoes. Although these volcanoes are only 15 km apart, their eruption behavior and the types of lava they emit are profoundly different, with Nyiragongo erupting some of the most unusual lava types found anywhere on Earth. To understand the roles of lithospheric mantle and metasomatic veins as magma sources, we will use existing major and trace element and isotopic data together with new data on volatile contents of olivine-hosted melt inclusions to establish parental melt compositions and source lithologies. Our data and modeling approach will also provide important constraints on parental magma CO2 and S concentrations and magma fluxes for each volcano. Our proposed work will use existing tephra and lava samples and will focus on the many parasitic cones and tuff rings on the flanks of Nyiragongo and Nyamulagira, as these erupt more primitive compositions than the volcanoes? central vents. For investigating the plumbing systems, we will use (1) melt inclusion volatile data to determine crystallization depths, (2) U-series mineral isochrons to determine crystal and magma residence times, (3) mineral zoning and diffusion chronometry to identify recharge and mixing processes that may trigger eruptions and yield precursory seismic signals, and (4) diffusive loss of H from melt inclusions to infer magma ascent rates during eruption, which likely influence explosivity. Our overarching goal is to produce geologically well-grounded, state-of-the-art geochemical and petrological data that improves our understanding of these volcanic systems and thereby improves hazard assessment models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding reactivity at the atomic or molecular scale has long been a central focus of the chemical sciences. Scientists have traditionally approached these questions through the analysis of bulk properties, employing techniques which probe upwards of millions of individual atoms or molecules simultaneously. Unfortunately, many systems of interest, such as nanoparticles, are extremely heterogeneous and exhibit significant variations in reactivity that are ?averaged out? in conventional studies. The ability to obtain measurements that reflect the reactivity of single chemical entities could fundamentally improve our understanding of these systems.  These techniques utilize small pipets as multipurpose tools to manipulate the position of single entities within a sample and to characterize their chemical behavior. The techniques are being validated and then applied to identify promising electrocatalyst materials for applications such as water splitting and CO2 reduction. Complementing these research efforts, the Hill group is also establishing a ""Measure Anything"" outreach program focused on measurement science, enabling K-12 students across Wyoming to design their own research projects that utilize analytical facilities at the University of Wyoming.<br/><br/>Heterogenous chemical systems play an important role in many modern technologies, but their design presents unique challenges not found in the traditional chemical world of small molecules. Entity-to-entity variations within heterogeneous ensembles make the elucidation of meaningful structure-function relationships difficult when using conventional analytical techniques. The ability to obtain measurements that reflect the reactivity of single chemical entities, such as nanoparticles, could fundamentally change the way heterogeneous chemical systems are developed. In the Hill lab, electroanalytical techniques are being developed to produce quantitatively-reliable single-entity data at the throughputs necessary to serve as a practical tool for guiding systems design. Small pipets ?dispense? individual entities at well-defined locations within a sample and probe the electrochemical behavior of these entities in a targeted fashion. The research entails both fundamental studies of each step of this single-entity electroanalytical approach and assessment of its practical utility to explore the reactivity of complex, high entropy alloy electrocatalyst materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Instead, this project will advance the concept of a ""robotic gym"": multiple specialized robotic trainers that teach multiple different skills to groups of humans, with each robotic trainer focusing on different skills and each human learner having different initial abilities and different potential for improvement. This represents a long-term planning problem with significant uncertainty (especially since current performance cannot always predict future improvement), and will be addressed with advanced artificial intelligence techniques that will be evaluated both in simulations and in actual human subjects studies. Results of the research will advance national health and wellbeing in many ways. They can most directly be used for robot-aided training in motor rehabilitation, sports, and surgery; furthermore, they can be broadly applied to any setting where machines are used to train groups of humans, including education and weight loss. The team will also develop new interdisciplinary courses in human-robot interaction, and will perform outreach about robotics to multiple groups, especially K-12 and community college students and teachers around Wyoming.<br/><br/>The project will be divided into three complementary work packages that will develop three elements of a proposed ""robotic gym"" - a multi-robot system that teaches multiple skills to groups of humans. The first work package will create an intelligent system that dynamically allocates multiple human trainees to multiple robotic trainers with the goal of maximizing individual and group training outcomes. The second work package will create ways of predicting future training outcome based on measurements of current and past performance, which can be used as a basis for decision-making by the intelligent allocation system. Finally, the third work package will create a collaborative human-robot planning framework that allows the robotic gym to learn training strategies from human experts (e.g., therapists) and to provide decision support to human experts, thus combining the complementary advantages of human and machine intelligence. The robotic gym will be evaluated in two ways throughout the project. First, the created software will be evaluated in simulations with many different variables (e.g., number of robots and humans, degree of uncertainty about current performance), providing the research community with detailed information about expected effectiveness in different scenarios.

This project, part of the Critical Zone Collaborative Network,  will establish the Bedrock Critical Zone Network that spans a wide range of climatic conditions across the continental US, ranging from a subtropical site in the South Carolina Piedmont to warm and dry sites in southern California. The principal goal is to improve knowledge of how subsurface processes in the deep Critical Zone influence water storage potential. In addition, the project will explore how water storage affects ecosystem resilience to disturbances such as prolonged drought. The research will involve direct sampling of subsurface materials via drilling and borehole logging together with non-invasive, indirect imaging techniques. The project will engage teachers, students, and the broader public in information sessions that emphasize the crucial importance of the Critical Zone, including development of a set of interactive 3D visualizations for use by educators.<br/><br/>The Critical Zone extends from treetop to bedrock and thus includes both the substrate for life and the organisms that live at Earth?s land surface. In hilly and mountainous landscapes, where erosion at the surface exhumes underlying bedrock, the deepest reaches of the Critical Zone are where bedrock begins the weathering process, where fluids and gases first penetrate and react, where biota begin to colonize and interact with minerals, and where pore space begins to open. This project establishes the Bedrock Critical Zone Network to provide the scientific community with new knowledge of the deep Critical Zone and its feedbacks with surface processes and ecosystems. Observations and modeling at seven sites spanning a wide range of climatic and bedrock conditions in the continental US will test the hypothesis that Critical Zone structure, evolution, and processes are strongly influenced by bedrock conditions at the base of the Critical Zone.  Mineralogy, ambient stress, and inherited fractures are influential factors, and these, in turn, are influenced by surface processes like erosion, subsurface flow, and ecosystem productivity. The project will address questions about fundamental deep Critical Zone properties and processes, including: controls on regolith thickness and its variation across landscapes; the relative importance and spatial variability of physical and chemical weathering; how subsurface weathering influences landscape evolution; and how deep Critical Zone  water storage affects ecosystem resilience.The project will engage teachers, students, and the broader public on the crucial importance of the Critical Zone ; train scientists at diverse career stages on how to communicate; and promote diversity, inclusion, and equity in Critical-Zone science through targeted programs. The project will undertake an outreach and engagement program that includes a new set of interactive 3D visualizations, called the ""Virtual Critical Zone,"" based on extensive imaging and measurements of roadcuts and quarries. This project will also include hands-on programs for high school teachers and students. All activities will support diversity and inclusion in Critical-Zone science through intentional recruiting and outreach.  This project is jointly funded by the Critical Zone Collaborative Network, the Geomorphology and Land-use Dynamics programs in the Division of Earth Sciences, as well as the Education Program in the Geosciences Directorate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the main weather regimes where cloud seeding is attempted is in mountainous terrain in areas where there is a significant amount of liquid water in the clouds.  Direct observational evidence of the chain of events from the release of cloud seeding material to the formation of precipitation was shown in data from a recent NSF-supported field campaign.  This award will provide researchers with the opportunity to further analyze data from that campaign to answer additional questions about the science behind cloud seeding.  The research represents a public-private partnership between NSF-sponsored scientists and a utility that provides hydroelectric power.  The next generation of scientists will also be trained during this project.<br/><br/>The research team will expand upon the analysis of field campaign data from the Seeded and Natural Orographic Wintertime clouds: the Idaho Experiment (SNOWIE) that was conducted in 2017.  Initial results have shown that cloud seeding in orographic regions can initiate snowfall in certain situations.  The research team will move beyond the obvious cases of cloud seeding impacts to analyze every case during the campaign, including those where cloud seeding was conducted while natural snowfall was also occurring.  The overarching goal of the project is to provide estimates, with uncertainty limits, of precipitation enhancement from glaciogenic cloud seeding for all SNOWIE seeding events.  This will involve coupling data analysis using the SNOWIE data set and state of the art modeling.  <br/><br/>The researchers have identified a set of questions to address the following research hypotheses:  1) Mesoscale and microscale updrafts observed in mostly stratiform orographic clouds are focal areas for the production of supercooled liquid water and sometimes natural ice particles, 2)	Airborne seeding of orographic clouds, under the right conditions, will produce changes in microphysical properties of clouds and precipitation detectable with in-situ and remote sensors, even in conditions where natural precipitation is occurring, and 3) For all SNOWIE cases, seeding impacts on precipitation over a mountain basin can be estimated quantitatively, and uncertainties established, through numerical simulations employing seeding parameterizations improved utilizing analyses from the observations.  NSF-supported researchers will collaborate with researchers at the National Center for Atmospheric Research and the Idaho Power Company.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, plant fossils present unique challenges that previously made this record inaccessible for large scale studies of Earth History. Plant organs, like leaves, wood, fruits, seeds are rarely preserved attached to each other, and it can be difficult to associate different organs as part of the same plant and assign formal taxonomic names to the isolated organs. None of the major paleontological databases can accommodate the informal names that are commonly used for isolated organs, and the necessary tools to coordinate such fossil plant data across institutions, researchers, time periods, and geography do not exist. This project will create the integrative Paleobotany Database (PBOT), an online public database of fossil plant descriptions for both informally and formally-named fossils, work-bench software, and community discussion forums. PBOT will integrate with existing online database resources, including museum specimen and occurrence records, to enable research on past plant diversity and evolution at scales not previously possible. PBOT will advance NSF?s mission of transparency in science, by making paleobotanical data and the scientific process more open and accessible to a broad range of users. For example, the database will make fossil plant data available to the public and educators at all levels for use in hands-on educational activities and for citizen science initiatives. Furthermore, the online workbench will provide a standardized resource for fossil plant description and data entry that will benefit students and professionals, as well as fossil enthusiasts. Overall, the PBOT infrastructure and platform will revolutionize the way paleobotanical data is shared and used, allowing for a myriad of scientific and societal uses, and charting a sustainable, long-term digital future for paleobotanical data management and research.<br/><br/>Paleobotanical data is severely underrepresented in major publicly accessible databases, even though fossil plants represent the best record of ancient terrestrial environments. A major impediment to the inclusion of paleobotanical data in databases at meaningful levels of taxonomy is that plant parts are most often preserved separately, with varying potential for taxonomic resolution. Paleobotanists therefore commonly use morphologically-based, informal taxonomies (morphotypes) rather than traditional Linnaean classifications. The names given to a particular morphotype are inconsistent among research groups, and currently there is no data-management infrastructure that allows comparison and synonymizing of morphotypes among regions or time periods or with published formal taxonomies. As a result, a large proportion of the millions of fossil plant specimens housed in museums worldwide are, together with their spatio-temporal occurrence data, inaccessible for inclusion in studies of paleobiology, paleoclimatology, Earth system modeling, macroevolution, and macroecology. This project will provide a long-needed solution to these problems by extending the Paleobiology Database (PBDB) with a Paleobotany Portal (PBOT) web client and database for (1) creating novel, dynamic, community-sourced character schemas for morphotypic plant descriptions; (2) entering and browsing informal and formal taxonomies via morphological characters; (3) applying these formal and informal taxonomies to digitized fossil plant specimens in Integrated Digitized Biocollections (iDigBio); and (4) maintaining a community forum for expert commentary on PBOT contents. As a part of this project, the researchers will use PBOT to populate PBDB with paleobotanical leaf fossil datasets from the Cretaceous through Eocene and analyze diversity and climate variation across the warmest intervals of the past 100 million years. Overall, data made available by PBOT will enable synthetic analyses of paleoclimate and plant macro-ecology and -evolution that have not been possible to date.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By bringing together a consortium of scientists currently using existing techniques from multiple disciplines, including computer science and applied mathematics, and competing these techniques with simulated and real data, we will evaluate the efficacy of existing methods. Further, we will build on these methods to develop novel hybrid modeling techniques and expanded use of linear and non-linear sparse models to maximize both the predictive accuracy and mechanistic insight of models applied to high dimensional data sets. We will apply these techniques to critical challenges in the life sciences, including mapping phenotypes to genomic data, modeling community dynamics in highly diverse systems, and disentangling the interplay among different temporal scales of drivers in aquatic ecosystems.

The main sampling platform is the University of Wyoming King Air (UWKA) research aircraft equipped with new measurement capabilities that allow for enhanced sampling strategies of gases and particulates. Gaseous species include reduced and oxidized nitrogen (NH3 and HNO3), methane (CH4), ethane (C2H6), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2) and water vapor (H2O), while particulates include aerosol concentration and size and their water-soluble species concentrations. CH4 and C2H6 allow to track the plume and distinguish between different source types. Integration of flight data with ground-based observations collected from mobile monitoring and existing sampling sites, provides a means to better interpret consistently available ground-based data in the future.

When similar species live in different habitats, natural selection may produce different specializations for each species. In North America, there are several species of small birds known as chickadees. Some chickadee species live in warmer climates, others live in colder ones. When their ranges overlap, the different species can hybridize with one another. The goal of the research is to understand whether hybrid chickadees have less efficient metabolisms and reduced survival when compared with non-hybrid chickadees. If hybrids have low survival this may help maintain separate species. Members of the public will be critical parts of the project.

This research will quantify the contribution of indoor greenery systems to building energy efficiency. Indoor living wall systems are becoming increasingly popular in modern commercial buildings, and this research will create a model to simulate the thermal interactions between indoor greenery systems and the local environment, where evapotranspiration from indoor living plants plays an important role. The research will quantify the effects of indoor greenery systems on building energy consumption and the effects of leaf-to-floor area ratio and evapotranspiration on occupant thermal comfort.<br/><br/>To accomplish the research objectives, the PI will create first a thermal model for indoor greenery systems that predicts evapotranspiration rates and the thermal interactions with the indoor environment and validate the model based on measurements from lab experiments. Second, the PI will identify the relationship between thermal comfort and leaf-to-floor area ratio and evapotranspiration for spaces with indoor greenery systems through thermal comfort experiments. Third, the PI will quantify the influence of indoor greenery systems on building performance through a coupled modeling approach that combines building energy simulation and indoor greenery system models. The knowledge gained is targeted to form the scientific foundation of design guidance for architects, interior designers, and engineers on indoor greenery systems and promote the integration of indoor greenery with HVAC systems for energy efficiency in future buildings.

Adaptation to environmental variation has commonly been inferred by examining how the appearance of organisms (phenotypes) and their DNA sequences (genotypes) vary across a broad range of climatic conditions. However, there has been increasing recognition of additional layers of complexity along the genome-to-phenotype spectrum that influence responses to the environment by altering expression of genetic variation. Epigenetic, or non-DNA sequence based, DNA modifications under different environmental conditions are increasingly considered to be a potent mechanism that may drive how organisms respond to different environments. Likewise, the different molecules associated with metabolic activity (metabolome) can vary among individuals or populations in different environments or can change under stressful conditions to alter organism function. Species that occur across altitudes experience rapid shifts in conditions, especially temperature, over short spatial scales, which provides advantages for teasing apart how different mechanisms influence tolerance of environmental variation. This project will focus on thermal tolerance across elevations in wild and laboratory reared bumble bees, an important group of pollinators that are threatened by environmental pressures. The project will provide valuable tools to understand how bee populations overcome environmental stress that will help predict the stability of bee populations. Post-doctoral fellows, graduate students and undergraduates at the University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa and University of Wyoming will be broadly trained in molecular biology, physiology and computational modeling approaches. A strategy game app to demonstrate how molecular changes can affect populations and ecosystems under different thermal conditions will be developed for K-12 students.  Results of the study will be disseminated through an exhibit at a native bee garden within the Stokes Nature Center in Utah to increase awareness of wild pollinators.<br/><br/>The major research goal of the project is to address the question: How does information flow from genetic and epigenetic variation through expression of this information to produce intraspecific phenotypes adapted to abiotic extremes? Thermal physiology experiments on field-collected and laboratory-reared bumble bees from elevation gradients in the Oregon Cascade Mountains will be combined with genomic, transcriptomic, methylomic, and metabolomic analyses. Computational modeling will be employed to integrate data sets and test how variation in epigenetic modification of DNA in different populations influences gene expression, and ultimately physiology, under cold temperature exposure. Specific research questions include: (1) are bumble bees capable of withstanding similar cold stress exposure regardless of geographic origin, or do individuals, social castes, and populations exhibit constitutive variation in cold tolerance associated with local climate? (2) to what degree do populations exhibit structured variation in DNA methylation, transcription, and metabolomics across environments versus plastic regulation of processes in response to cold stress?, and (3) how do epigenetic changes within individual organisms influence transcription and in turn production of small molecules to explain variation in cold tolerance across individuals, castes, colonies, and environments?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The award includes scientific effort to support field deployments of the facility, data assurance and quality control, delivery and archiving of data products accessible to the entire scientific community; and the engineering effort for instrumentation and software upgrades that will enhance the scientific and educational benefit to the community. The impact of the research enabled by the facility may be broad and far-reaching depending on the individual projects that request its use through the National Science Foundation's Lower Atmospheric Observing Facilities Program.<br/><br/>The Wyoming research aircraft along with the Wyoming Cloud Radar, the Wyoming Cloud Lidar, and associated research instruments will enable acquisition of airborne in-situ and remote sensing measurements to address a broad range of geoscience-related topics. Support of the facility will ensure access to a mission-ready research aircraft and associated instrumentation. The Wyoming King Air is capable of use in studies ranging from cloud-aerosol interaction, to boundary-layer dynamics, air quality, cloud and precipitation physics, and chemistry of trace gases and aerosol. The data collected by the Wyoming King Air facility will take advantage of the combined in situ measurements from the aircraft and remote sensing capability of the Wyoming Cloud Radar and the Wyoming Cloud Lidar, targeting projects that can benefit from the agility of the aircraft and its low cost of operation. The measurement capabilities available to the geoscience community through this award will provide a greater understanding of atmospheric properties and composition, inform new ideas about atmospheric processes, feed numerical models to improve atmospheric representation, and ultimately lead to greater predictability of the earth-atmosphere weather and climate systems. In addition to the far-reaching broader impacts of the scientific studies that are enabled by the aircraft, the impacts of the work supported through this award are rooted in their contribution to education and training of the next generation of observational atmospheric scientists. Since the University of Wyoming King Air is owned and operated by a university, it provides a natural setting for educating and training young scientists in obtaining and using airborne atmospheric observations and in the development of tools and techniques for maintaining, calibrating, and assessing airborne instrumentation. The skills developed by scientists who use and work with the facility and associated data sets are well-suited to train the next generation of atmospheric scientists to work within laboratories or other airborne research facilities across the country.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project assembles a network improvement community comprised of partners from the University of Wyoming, community colleges, Wyoming school districts, the Wyoming Library System, the Wyoming Department of Education, and local software development firms. The community meets once monthly over the duration of the project to collaborate stakeholder agendas for meeting the project goals. The community enlists K-8 teachers from across the state to experience professional development and collaborate on integrating computer science into their instruction of STEM and social science topics. The project is producing units for teachers, who are implementing these units with support from master teachers and educational scholars. The community serves as a forum for teachers to debrief and learn from each other about ways to improve their instruction and design of the curricular units. Libraries in the state system act as partners for dissemination to rural areas of the innovative instructional approaches.<br/><br/>This project is preparing 150 K-8 teachers and state librarians from all disciplines to integrate computer science into their teaching. The project is reaching almost half of all K-8 students in Wyoming. The research questions address how teachers use modeling practices as supports for student understanding of algorithms and coding in a variety of ways. The curricula involve cyber security as well as other topics relevant to measurement in mathematics and social studies topics that involve social concerns like voting. Data sources include teacher lesson plans and recordings of their instructional implementation, scoring of each of these according to a rubric, meeting notes of monthly meetings, and results from pre-post student assessments. Evaluation focuses on the meeting of project goals and the quality of the management of the network improvement community. This project is jointly funded by CS for All and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One promising approach to advance prediction in ecology is to determine how traits of species determine their success in a given environment. Traits are attributes of species, such as plant height or body size, that influence their performance (survival and reproduction). In this project the researchers will establish relationships between traits and performance of key plant species to make general predictions about how other species in plant communities will perform. Climate scientists predict that drought may occur more frequently in the southwestern United States. Plants that can resist wilting during dry periods are likely to be winners during long-term drought, so this project will help determine which species will win and lose in a drier climate. This study will train undergraduate students, graduate students, and a secondary school teacher how to quantify plant traits and use them to model population dynamics. By linking physiological traits to plant performance, the results of this study will be used to develop general predictions for plant responses to environmental change.<br/><br/>Theory predicts that functional traits determine fitness differences among species, but direct evidence for this is still lacking for long-lived organisms. Given the inherent difficulty of quantifying fitness, ecologists typically link traits to vital rates rather than to fitness itself. However, analyzing trait-vital rate relationships in isolation can be misleading because of well-documented trade-offs among vital rates. Individual growth rates can be a poor proxy for fitness because the growth-mortality tradeoff can generate variation in growth rates that yield equal fitness. This research will contribute new understanding of the net effects of functional traits on fitness by integrating rates of growth, survival and reproduction across multiple populations of coexisting perennial plant species. This contribution will fill an important gap in knowledge by demonstrating how effects of traits on individual vital rates compare to the net effect of traits on total fitness. Evolutionary models of dynamic fitness landscapes will be confronted with experimental data to test predictions of how traits influence fitness in response to experimental rainfall manipulations. This research will provide an empirical foundation for theories that integrate population ecology, evolutionary biology, and ecophysiology, by developing generalizable trait-based models of population dynamics to predict responses to changing environmental conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
