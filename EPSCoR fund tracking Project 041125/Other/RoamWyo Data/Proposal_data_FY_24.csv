When we first started our discussions, our Director (Brian Harnisch) was in communication with REDD (Ashley Schnell specifically), regarding the possibility of WGFD sole-sourcing this work to us through a grant.  WGFD first approached WYSAC to conduct these surveys as a way to bring the project into the state, as well as build a long-term relationship between WYSAC and WGFD for additional ""Human Dimensions of Wildlife Management"" work, above and beyond the actual harvest surveys.

The sponsor of this project is One Health Insights, who is ultimately hiring us to do a survey for a project sponsored by the Wyoming Department of Health.  They have requested use of the 20% indirect rate that we grant to Wyoming State agencies.  I wasn't sure how to make that request through ROAM, so I am putting it here!  The indirect cost amount that I have listed in the Summary Budget is at the standard 34%.  I have attached the Draft Statement of Work that goes into more detail about the project.

PRE-FIELDING COSTS
As has been discussed with the Pre-Award Services team, a percentage of the award amount will be needed once the contract has been signed, but before IRB ""approval"" can be obtained. I am requesting that $20,000 be available for these pre-fielding associated costs (IRB proposal development, mailing material ordering, questionnaire printing).",No,,300000007170088,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,No,,,,Research & Economic Development,,,,,,,,,,No,,,No,,,Michael Dorssom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Wyoming Survey & Analysis Center,300000007170088,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Social Sciences,50,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,Thao Pham McVay,US Citizen,W05258353,Not Hispanic or Latino,Female,No,,,No,,,,,One Health Immunization Survey,,,No,No,,,Proposal Created,Michael Dorssom,7/10/2023 01:04:37 PM,,Yes,,,,No,,,,,Other Sponsored Activities,,34% MTDC,No,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,No,Pending,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,[Research & Economic Development],,,,,,[On Campus],,,,,3bb602c7-e33b-4750-8087-387538b10573,,,,,,,Direct Request for Services,,,,No,,,true,,,US Citizen,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,100,W02240030,Not Hispanic or Latino,,,,Male,Wyoming Survey & Analysis Center,300000007170088,Michael D.

Following are details provided by them:

Good afternoon!

So, I included a PowerPoint overview of the HCBS measures set that CMS is, ""proposing."" I've also included the CMS CAHPS Home and Community Based Services Survey, as well as the data analysis guide. This hopefully will give you a better picture of what we are looking at and what it will take to accomplish. We also haven't been given the complete picture from CMS yet, but this is as much information as we have at the moment while reading between the lines. Feel free to ask any questions or if you have any concerns. Thank you!

Sample size: With approximately 2400 members on waiver, a confidence level of 95% with a +/-5% margin of error would require a recommended sample size of 332.
Mode: Based on the survey type/analysis guide, I would think the best results would come from a phone call, with a similar approach as the Montana Medicaid survey. However, we are definitely open to ideas from the subject matter experts.
Contact List: We can provide a random sample and contact list for those sample members.
Timeline: Completed annually, our first waiver year out of five waiver years, would begin next year.
