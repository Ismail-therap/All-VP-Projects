Because of this, snow hydrology research in recent years has used a variety of techniques to model and observe snowmelt processes. However, a disconnect between observed physical processes and modeling capabilities has been revealed, exposing a need to improve understanding of snowmelt dynamics. This research will fill a knowledge gap in understanding how the snowpack stores and transmits liquid water to streams. This project will develop a snowmelt monitoring program for both research and educational opportunities. Scientific advancements will be made while also providing experiential learning opportunities for both university and K-12 students across Wyoming, including Native American populations in the Wind River Reservation. In total, two Ph.D. students and one M.S. student will be involved in scientific research while approximately 20 undergraduate students, 300 high school students, and 1,250 middle school students will gain a broad understanding of hydrologic sciences through outreach and field activities. Through field observations and modeling, this project will identify when and where common model representations of snowmelt processes need to be improved. The results will be broadly applicable rather than specific to individual watersheds for the purpose of improving future streamflow forecasting models to benefit stakeholders across the United States and beyond. <br/><br/>The overall scope of this NSF CAREER project is to improve fundamental knowledge of the hydro-terrestrial system in headwater catchments and produce transformational understanding of hydrologic fluxes within a snowpack. This project will test a model structure that includes representation of previously observed liquid water dynamics in a snowpack that are not currently included in models. Thus, the overarching goals of this proposal are to: 1) Develop a long-term monitoring program to define a snowpack?s role in storing and transmitting liquid water to streams under various conditions; and 2) develop a long-term educational program that promotes mountain hydrology across the University of Wyoming campus and STEM education to underrepresented groups. This project will use a combination of traditional hydrology field work, geophysical observations of a melting snowpack, and advanced modeling techniques to conduct investigations. The results of this work will identify when and where consideration of the snowpack as an ?extension of the vadose zone? is important for hydrologic modeling based on watershed characteristics while providing unique experiential learning opportunities for students at the University of Wyoming and beyond.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Water, Landscape, and Critical Zone Processes program,and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This work will be conducted in collaboration with researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.  A long-standing challenge to the economical production of lipid-based biofuels, such as biodiesel, relates to how and when cells accumulate lipids. Lipid accumulation is triggered upon cell stress severe enough that it also arrests cell growth; therefore, cells must first be grown and then transferred to different conditions to trigger significant lipid accumulation. We have developed a simple system in which the bacterium Rhodococcus opacus PD630 grows on a dilute agricultural by-product with significant lipid accumulation during growth. This system is unique because it outperforms attempts to engineer microbial lipid accumulation during growth. The goals of this work are to: 1) identify which feature(s) of the agricultural by-product stimulates lipid accumulation during growth for identification of other cheap, abundant feedstocks and 2) understand how cells accumulate lipids during growth so this can be engineered into other microbial systems for economical bioproduction. To accomplish this, the deep expertise in lipid-accumulating microbes at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory will be leveraged to understand how our unique system works. The results of this project will be used to identify strategies to engineer other microbial systems for a simpler, more economical production of renewable, lipid-based biofuels and biochemicals. This project directly addresses a long-standing challenge for economical microbial biofuel production.<br/><br/>The overall goal of the project is to identify targets for the forward engineering of other systems to stimulate lipid accumulation during growth for economical microbial lipid production. This research directly addresses a long-standing challenge to economic microbial lipid production with the overall goal of moving to a renewable bioeconomy for fuels and materials.  The PI developed a system in which the bacterium Rhodococcus opacus PD630 grows on a dilute agricultural by-product with significant lipid accumulation during growth, with biomass accumulation to ~3 g/L (dry weight) in 48 hours of batch culture. The collected biomass is 43% fatty acids, which is equal to that observed when R. opacus PD630 is grown on glucose and growth-arrested for ideal lipid accumulation conditions in the laboratory. This NSF EPSCoR RII EPSCoR Research Fellows project will support the PI and a graduate student to work with an expert in lipid-accumulating microbes at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Working together, the PI and collaborator will determine: 1) which characteristics of the dilute agricultural by-product are critical for lipid accumulation during growth and 2) which metabolic pathways are active when cells accumulate lipids during growth. The dilute agricultural by-product will be characterized by the measurement of total organic carbon, inorganic carbon, total nitrogen, major and minor ions, as well as organic acids and sugars in the by-product before, during, and after growth. Individual components will be added to the medium to assess impacts on lipid accumulation. Metabolic pathways active during simultaneous growth and lipid accumulation will be identified through transcriptomic, lipidomic, and untargeted metabolomic analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award addresses this challenge through an integrated educational and research program. The research program focuses on advancing the state-of-the-art composite modeling and design capabilities for composites involving nonlinear behavior and potential damage under extreme loading conditions. This framework will be utilized to uncover the fundamental relationship between the microstructure's constituent properties, geometries, and structural performance. A comprehensive educational plan is to train the next generation of professionals with a strong background in composites to meet the nation?s growing demand for high-performance materials. <br/><br/>The goal of this CAREER award is to elucidate the microstructure-property-performance relationship for composite materials by developing and exercising an efficient and accurate multiscale reduced order modeling and design framework. First, an adaptive multiscale reduced order model for rapid multiscale analysis and probing of the material response space will be developed. The model will consider realistic composite material behavior with a focus on viscoelastic behavior and damage of the matrix, damage of the reinforcement, and cohesive debonding of the material interface. The multiscale model will be thoroughly verified against direct numerical simulation and validated using experimental data for different hybrid composites. Finally, the model will be incorporated into a multi-resolution gradient-based reduced order design (material and shape) framework that enables the efficient design of hybrid composite microstructures. The modeling and design framework will empower us to develop advanced composites with tailored mechanical properties.

Traditional authentication methods like PINs, passwords, facial recognition and fingerprints are proving inadequate and vulnerable to attacks. This vulnerability is further exacerbated by the nature of immersive environments, where users' attention is often diverted from external stimuli, making traditional authentication methods less reliable. Additionally, biometric methods face challenges such as susceptibility to presentation attacks, where adversaries attempt to deceive the system using fake biometric data, further emphasizing the necessity for advanced authentication mechanisms tailored specifically for AR and VR systems. This project aims to address these challenges by leveraging Electroencephalography (EEG) signals, which measure the electrical activity in a user's brain. The objective is to develop and revolutionize user authentication methods to both secure and enhance human-computer interaction within AR/VR environments.  Additionally, the proposed effort includes educational activities for both undergraduate and graduate students; and activities for broadening participation in STEM fields. Through research, education, and outreach efforts, the project seeks to shape the trajectory of emerging technology toward a more secure and equitable digital landscape.<br/><br/>The goal of this work is to develop novel user authentication algorithms tailored specifically for AR/VR systems. The idea is to harness EEG signals of the user's brain to develop user authentication algorithms that are not only secure but also lightweight and user-friendly.

One prominent branch of QIS is quantum computing. Over recent years, we have seen the successful creation of quantum computer prototypes across various platforms. Yet, their practical applications remain restricted. A major challenge facing current superconductor-based quantum computers is noise interference, which can easily disrupt quantum states. Motivated by this, researchers at the University of Wyoming have speculated that two-dimensional (2D) materials, exhibiting single crystalline properties down to the atomic scale, might pave the way for the next generation of quantum computers. With the support of this fellowship, the PI will gain invaluable training experience, expanding his skills in designing and characterizing superconducting qubits.

This endeavor could herald the dawn of a new generation of quantum computers, marked by heightened fidelity and largely increased coherence times - a significant advancement eagerly anticipated by the quantum computing community worldwide. At the University of Wyoming, the research team is poised to harness a diverse toolkit of methodologies, from the preparation and handling of 2D materials to the fabrication and characterization of 2D superconducting Josephson junctions. The close collaboration with LLNL offers the most critical edge. With access to LLNL's world-class quantum computing test beds, the Wyoming team will receive training and gain hands-on experience in superconducting qubit design, creation, and characterization.

Although less than one-fifth of the U.S. population lives in rural areas, these areas encompass about 97% of the total land area in the United States and thus the population density for rural areas is low. Traditionally, mainstream epidemiological models focus on settings with high population density, such as major U.S. cities. To study rural epidemiology, it is necessary to develop epidemiological models and analyses tailored to the unique demographics and geographic isolation of rural areas. This grant brings together expertise in mathematical modeling, high-performance computing, geographic information systems, and medical sociology to develop a framework for reliable and accurate real-time epidemic forecasts for mountain-West States, such as Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, and Colorado. The project involves constructing a data-driven multiscale mobility network, using the combination of de-biased mobile phone data, American Community Survey (ACS), and census data in these regions. With a multiscale mobility network, the principal investigators (PIs) will be able to examine how containment policies during a pandemic, such as mobility reduction interventions, stay-at-home orders, and State border lockdowns, impact the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases, and how such policies may exacerbate the disparities of public health and social inequalities in rural areas. The study will help government health officials develop equitable policies and mitigation strategies for rural places in the future epidemic. Furthermore, the proposed community outreach will raise awareness of disease prevention in Wyoming.<br/> <br/>This grant offers solutions to three research questions in rural epidemiology: Q1. How to construct a metapopulation mobility network tailored to rural places? Human mobility is one of the factors driving the spread of infectious diseases across wide geographical ranges. The project introduces a metapopulation model embedded in a multiscale data-driven mobility network tailored to the unique structures of rural population density and human moving patterns for simulating infection dynamics of the front-range States. For this metapopulation mobility model, the PIs will adapt and improve the efficiency of Gillespie?s event-driven algorithms and derive a proper time step for large-scale stochastic simulations. The PIs will also implement an efficient particle filter algorithm for data assimilations to estimate local transmission parameters at two scales. Q2. How to detect and correct mobile phone data bias? If the bias of the mobile phone data used to construct the mobility networks is not addressed, infection dynamics simulations may incorrectly estimate the severity and speed of disease transmission. The project will investigate the bias of mobile phone data used to construct the mobility network and develop a method to offset the data bias. Q3. What are the impacts of containment measures on disadvantaged racial and socioeconomic groups? The PIs will use the proposed unbiased multiscale metapopulation mobility model to study the impacts of temporary mobility reductions and their lasting behavior-modifying effects on the disadvantaged racial and socioeconomic groups in the front-range States.<br/><br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the MPS Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) through the Mathematical Biology Program, the SBE Division of Social and Economic Sciences (SES), and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This event completely changed the trajectory of the evolutionary tree of life, leading ultimately to the formation of today?s mammal-dominated communities. The aftermath of the K/Pg mass extinction represents a natural laboratory in which ecosystem reorganization can be studied with high geologic resolution. Some studies have been undertaken to examine how marine ecosystems were rebuilt, but the response of terrestrial environments is poorly documented.  This project will examine ecological and environmental changes that occurred on land across the K/Pg boundary in the Rocky Mountain region of the western United States. The research will involve extensive paleontological and geochemical analyses of existing fossil collections and introduce novel data that will reveal the variability in the timing and pattern of terrestrial ecosystem rebuilding after the mass extinction. This project will expand knowledge of a major turning point in the history of life on Earth that will help determine how the biodiversity of ecosystems recover at the continental scale and how modern terrestrial biota evolved. The results may also provide data for conservation biologists to predict the long-term consequences of current rapid changes in biodiversity and help inform conservation priorities to alleviate ecosystem disruptions. The project will use established programs in classrooms, museum exhibits, and outreach at the participating institutions to reach audiences of multiple ages and backgrounds.<br/><br/>The K/Pg mass extinction completely changed the trajectory of the evolutionary tree of life and most research has focused on marine systems. Post-extinction patterns of ecosystem restructuring on land, fundamental to understanding the evolution of the modern taxa of mammals and plants, have received little attention because fossil collections, data, and high-resolution chronostratigraphic sections are relatively rare. This project will build on extensive fossil collections from three primary study areas in the Western Interior of North America, involve new fieldwork designed to augment collections and data from critical intervals, and develop diverse inorganic and organic geochemical records to characterize and identify biotic patterns, local environments, and factors involved in terrestrial ecosystem restructuring following the K/Pg extinction. To accomplish these goals, the research team will: collect and interpret megafloral, palynological, invertebrate, and vertebrate fossils and associated contextual data from three well-studied stratigraphic sections; use fossil leaf physiognomic traits and geochemical data from organic compounds to construct records of temperature, precipitation, and fire frequency; integrate ecological proxies of community structure and environmental conditions over time and space as they relate to the three study areas, to determine if there are any climatic conditions, geographic locations, or trophic interactions that enhance or impede ecosystem restructuring after the K/Pg extinction. In addition, geochemical proxies for volcanic activity will be examined to resolve the influence of the extensive basalt eruptions of the Deccan Traps on the biota within the study areas.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Frontier Research in Earth Sciences (FRES) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some hypotheses predict that organisms will repair tissues necessary for reproduction, while allowing other tissues to age. Other hypotheses predict the opposite: tissues related to reproduction will age faster because of selection for early life fitness. This research will examine aging dynamics across life stages and tissues, and in response to stress. Bees are an ideal system to probe the mechanistic underpinnings of extreme differences in lifespan, yielding general insight into regulators of aging. Bee life-cycles are short compared to vertebrates and its possible to examine lifetime patterns of senescence. And, many aspects of cellular senescence are conserved across insects and vertebrates. Investigating how aging dynamics differ among species may lead to new ways of disrupting negative effects of aging. Understanding aging is particularly pressing in a world in which organisms are increasingly exposed to stress and many bee species are in decline. The proposed research will support the training of six graduate students and six undergraduate students. A K-12 learning module on bumble bee spring emergence will be developed as a hands-on lesson to engage Native American high school students in STEM. As part of an ongoing collaboration, informational exhibits and outreach events about pollinators will be developed with the Red River Valley Zoo (Fargo, ND) and Science Kids and Wyoming PBS (Laramie, WY). <br/><br/>The objective of the proposed research is to integrate physiology with life history theory to mechanistically explain patterns of aging. Insect metamorphosis may be an extreme version of the disposable soma hypothesis. During metamorphosis, larval tissues are recycled and replaced by imaginal cells with stem cell-like properties, which have the potential to be cellularly ?younger? than the tissues they replace. Insect metamorphosis may provide an opportunity to dispose of damaged somatic tissues, mitigating the effects of juvenile exposure to stress. Insect overwintering, also known as diapause, also has important implications for aging. Diapause increases lifespans by six times compared to non-diapausing individuals. This research will determine how metamorphosis and diapause contribute to aging dynamics by examining cellular damage and organismal performance by: 1) determining the relationship between senescence and cellular markers of aging, 2) examining how the disposable soma during metamorphosis influences aging by comparing cellular aging in tissues formed during metamorphosis to those carried over from the larval stage, and 3) assessing whether overwintering dormancy is a slowing down of aging or is regenerative. The proposed research will investigate these dynamics in solitary bees and bumble bees, and will strengthen an already productive collaboration between NDSU, UW, and the USDA-ARS, and greatly extend what is known about the mechanisms that contribute to variation in senescence.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Integrative Ecological Physiology program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the dimensions of these matrices are usually very large, classical tools in linear algebra are inadequate to tackle this situation. One common theme of random matrix theory is that a large family of random matrices shares the same limiting distribution due to universality phenomena. This is an analogue of the central limit theorem in classical probability, where the only requirements for the i.i.d. random variables are some moment conditions. Hence, random matrix theory can make sense of large-scale data under very mild assumptions. Random matrices of large dimension can often be modeled by nonrandom operators living in some abstract operator algebras, where these operators satisfy some highly nontrivial relations characterized by Voiculescu?s free independence. These nonrandom operators are free random variables in free probability theory. The principal investigator will study probability distributions of free random variables and the convergence of suitable random matrix models. The project provides research opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students. <br/><br/>This project, supported by a LEAPS-MPS award, aims to develop analytic tools for studying fundamental questions regarding the limiting distributions of important random matrix models. These questions are motivated by questions from mathematics, statistics, combinatorics, and quantum information. The Brown measure of a free random variable is a spectral measure that generalizes the eigenvalue distribution of square matrices. One major objective is to develop new techniques for calculating Brown measures, which provide predictions for the limits of non-Hermitian random matrices. The Hermitian reduction method and subordination functions are powerful tools for deriving Brown measure formulas. The new results on Brown measures open the door to the study of random matrix models that were previously inaccessible. <br/><br/>Free probability theory offers a conceptual approach to studying random matrices of large dimensions. The principal investigator will identify the limiting free random variables for various random matrix models arising from high-dimensional statistics and quantum information theory. In particular, the principal investigator will examine the spectrum of the full rank deformed single-ring random matrix model, the autocovariance matrix of time series, and the k-positivity of random tensor networks. Additionally, the PI will explore the theory of epsilon-freeness and investigate its applications to quantum information.

A species' geographic distribution refers to the places where populations of that species can be found. The edge of a species' distribution is its geographic range boundary - the species can be found within this boundary, but not outside of it. Although all species have boundaries, the underlying mechanisms determining where and how they form remain poorly understood for two key reasons. First, some of the hypothesized mechanisms are difficult to manipulate in natural settings. Second, researchers have historically approached this problem from either an ecological or evolutionary perspective which can be difficult to merge. Here, the researchers will use a combination of computation models and laboratory experiments on flour beetles growing in artificial landscapes to test multiple hypotheses behind the factors that determine species' geographic distributions. A better understanding of the factors that determine range limits will be crucial for improved management of invasive and endangered species and for predicting how species will change their ranges in response to climate change. In addition to potential insights into pressing conservation concerns, the researchers will actively engage the public through interactive activities at local farmers? markets to teach the public, particularly children, about the importance of ecology and evolution in natural populations and agriculture.<br/><br/>The researchers will use microcosms of the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, a common agricultural pest species, to manipulate the rate of change in environmental conditions, the level of dispersal, and the presence of an ecological competitor. These factors will be systematically varied to test each of their direct and interacting effects on the formation and location of range limits. Further, the researchers will use single patch controls to test for adaptation to different environmental conditions in the absence of dispersal from populations in other environmental conditions. DNA of beetles from the microcosm landscapes and the single patch controls will be sequenced to identify the genomic basis of adaptation and quantify the amount of genetic drift at the range edges. These experimental results will be combined with genetically explicit simulation models to test additional parameter values not tested in the mesocosm experiments. Overall, the project will provide critical data testing how environmental gradients and interspecific interactions interact with dispersal, adaptation, and genetic drift to affect range limits. This information may also be useful in controlling this agricultural pest species.

However, the specific processes that alter soil characteristics to increase flooding and erosion are not well understood. Soil sealing is one of the less studied post-wildfire processes because the peak impact of soil sealing occurs immediately after a wildfire when it can be difficult and dangerous to make field observations. However, this time period immediately after a wildfire also holds the highest risk for high damage flooding due to the lack of vegetation. To investigate the soil sealing processes that occur immediately after a wildfire, the investigators in this project will conduct laboratory experiments to simulate rainfall on burned soils and ash materials. The outcomes will provide new information about post-wildfire soil sealing processes with implications for forest management and disaster mitigation. Additionally, this project will support the development of technical skills for four college students and the development of a 4th and 5th grade science lesson on soil erosion.<br/><br/>The overarching research question of this project is: how does the slope angle of a land surface affect soil sealing processes immediately after a wildfire, and how does this impact infiltration for consequent rain events? As slope angle increases, surface ash erosion rates will increase. As a result, it is hypothesized that soil surfaces that experience increased storage of ash will promote soil sealing processes that decrease infiltration during later rain events, thereby increasing runoff. To test this hypothesis, laboratory scale rainfall simulations will be conducted at a range of slope angles on simulated burned soil conditions. Investigators will observe the effect of slope angle by (1) quantifying the effect of slope angle on surface ash erosion and surface storage through rainfall experiments, and (2) determining the effect of ash retention, if any, on soil properties after rainfall experiments. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Hydrologic Sciences and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The rare earth elements (REEs) are important components in many facets of our day-to-day life, for example, in permanent magnets, many electronics, and batteries in hybrid cars. Platinum group elements (PGEs) are important components in catalytic agents and are utilized in many industrial and electronic applications. Despite critical element enrichment in many alkaline magmatic systems, our understanding of the igneous processes that influence their enrichment and distribution is limited. A better understanding of the igneous processes that control critical element concentrations in alkaline systems can aid in informing focused critical element exploration. This project aims to evaluate igneous processes that may influence the enrichment and distribution of PGEs and REEs within the alkaline magmatic system at the Rattlesnake Hills Alkaline Complex, Wyoming. Broader impacts of this project include graduate student training, research experience for undergraduate students, and the development of 3D rock models and associated assignments for distribution to educators. This project is jointly funded by the Petrology and Geochemistry program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>Alkaline systems show extreme variation in critical element enrichment (e.g., REEs, PGEs, Te, V, W, Ba, and F) and Au contents. The proposed project will evaluate potential controls on critical element enrichment at the Rattlesnake Hills alkaline complex (RHAC). End-member hypotheses for critical element enrichment include: 1) country rock control, potentially as crustal assimilation or hydrothermal scavenging and redistribution of critical elements from country rock, 2) liquid immiscibility, and 3) initial composition of alkaline magmas. The project will document the igneous history of the RHAC, distinguishing timing and sources of igneous units and their relationship to mineralization. Geochemical and isotopic data will be collected to evaluate the input of critical elements from country rock. The role of liquid immiscibility will be investigated through the use of geochemical and melt inclusion data. Despite recognition of economic enrichment in alkaline systems for over 100 years, the processes that control critical element enrichment within these deposits are unclear. Understanding these controls will better elucidate the evolution of shallowly-emplaced, mantle-derived melts, the cycling of critical minerals in the upper-crust, and inform targeted exploration for critical minerals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research will quantify the effects of indoor greenery systems on building energy consumption and the effects of leaf-to-floor area ratio and evapotranspiration on occupant thermal comfort.<br/><br/>To accomplish the research objectives, the PI will create first a thermal model for indoor greenery systems that predicts evapotranspiration rates and the thermal interactions with the indoor environment and validate the model based on measurements from lab experiments. Second, the PI will identify the relationship between thermal comfort and leaf-to-floor area ratio and evapotranspiration for spaces with indoor greenery systems through thermal comfort experiments. Third, the PI will quantify the influence of indoor greenery systems on building performance through a coupled modeling approach that combines building energy simulation and indoor greenery system models. The knowledge gained is targeted to form the scientific foundation of design guidance for architects, interior designers, and engineers on indoor greenery systems and promote the integration of indoor greenery with HVAC systems for energy efficiency in future buildings.
