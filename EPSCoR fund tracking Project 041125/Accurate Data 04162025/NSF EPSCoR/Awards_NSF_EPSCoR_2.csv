Food security, food nutritional quality, and the viability of disadvantaged communities are especially threatened by climate change. An educated application of Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) provides one avenue to mitigate climate pressure on tribal communities and meet future food demand in a sustainable manner. Advances in and widespread adoption of CEA are, however, limited by several factors. Significant knowledge gaps exist in the science underpinning CEA. Additionally, there has been limited investment in relevant research, community engagement, and workforce development. This project is a collaboration among community colleges, universities, tribal nations, and community organizations located in three NSF EPSCoR jurisdictions: University of New Mexico, New Mexico State University, and Santa Fe Community College (New Mexico); University of Wyoming (Wyoming); and University of South Dakota and Sicangu Community Development Corporation (South Dakota). The three collaborating jurisdictions are home to 36 federal reservations. The project team brings together community members and researchers from diverse fields (e.g., economists, engineers, biologists, and plant physiologists) and consists of early-career, mid-career, and established researchers. This project provides opportunities for learning among universities, community colleges, industry, and tribal communities to allow for the development of tailored CEA systems and a climate-smart and community-based workforce. The human and information infrastructure developed under this project is anticipated to attract and retain talent, stimulate economic development, and confer climate resilience in tribal communities within and across jurisdictions.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to empirically determine best practices for secure CEA food production and to quantify the socio-economic impacts of CEA on tribal communities across the collaborating EPSCoR jurisdictions. The project proposes to take a convergence science approach to tackling food security under climate change, drawing upon diverse expertise with researchers ranging from basic (plant physiology and plant-microbe interactions) and applied biology (CEA and horticulture), environmental and natural resource economics, engineering, sustainability science, and applied knowledge of tribal community members. The research project leverages each institution's unique and complementary research expertise and resources to accomplish the following three objectives: (1) characterize how the environment, plants, and microbes interact in hydroponic systems and affect crop yield and nutritional quality; (2) identify environmental, nutritional, and socio-economic drivers and impacts of CEA on tribal communities to enhance climate resilience strategies via CEA; and (3) empower tribal communities through interdisciplinary training aimed at long-term retention of a highly-skilled climate-smart CEA workforce. The project includes training and mentoring activities for undergraduate and graduate students, post-doctoral scholars, early career faculty, and various tribal communities, including farmers, students K-12, and industry personnel. This project is funded by the EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement-Focused EPSCoR Collaborations (RII-FEC) program. The RII-FEC program builds inter-jurisdictional collaborative teams of EPSCoR investigators in focus areas consistent with the NSF Strategic Plan. RII-FEC projects include researchers from at least two EPSCoR jurisdictions with complementary expertise and resources necessary to address challenges, which neither party could address as well or as rapidly independently.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Researchers will identify challenges, quantify risks, and predict societal consequences of shifting climate conditions in the nation?s critical headwater areas, limited by uncertainties in how hydrological, ecological, and sociological systems interact.  Wyoming provides the prefect system to study these climate uncertainties due to its mountainous ecosystems that link high-elevation National Parks and other federal lands to a mosaic of lower-elevation tribal, state, federal, and private lands and waters. The project is designed to create solutions to strains on water availability resulting from climate change by building trusted networks with communities who will have opportunities to provide input as well as help the project team formulate outcomes.  The project will provide significant opportunities to engage Wyoming communities in STEM education and develop significant computational resources for the state.   WY-ACT will be administered by the University of Wyoming in collaboration with Central Wyoming College and Western Ecosystem Technology, a private company.<br/><br/>The Anticipating the Climate-Water Transition and Cascading Challenges to Socio-Environmental Systems in America's Headwaters (WY-ACT) project will create a world-class research and STEM training facility that will address critical water resource challenges arising from climate change in Wyoming and the Rocky Mountain region.  WY-ACT?s goals are to: 1) identify climate-driven risks to interacting hydrological, ecological and social systems; 2) reveal opportunities and limits for how communities and stakeholders respond to climate-induced risks; 3) evaluate how the process of co-production enhances adaptive capacity for key stakeholders by building trust in numerical models; and 4) integrate the understanding and quantification of risks and uncertainties across climate, hydrological, ecological, and social systems that are informed by models, observations, and stakeholder collaboration.  These project goals will be achieved by a transdisciplinary approach that includes social science, climate science, economics, hydrology, data science, ecology, and communication.   Additionally, this project recognizes the value of involving Tribal Nations in co-production, and will include indigenous knowledge, practitioner knowledge, experiential knowledge, and scientific ways of understanding to inform and enhance the understanding of changing water availability and its implications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Data acquisition and availability are outpacing our capacity for analysis, including the development of models that represent our knowledge of biological processes. This collaborative project among three universities in Wyoming, Montana, and Nevada will address this pressing need in the life sciences through research and education efforts led by our consortium.  Some types of models can fit observed data very well, but lack generality and the ability to extrapolate to novel settings or future time points.  Conversely, other types of models can be more general, but provide a poorer fit to individual data sets.  In our research we will develop knowledge of these trade-offs and methods that combine advantageous features of different types of models.  In each year our consortium will train a diverse cohort of twelve postdoctoral researchers in cutting edge modeling techniques and prepare them for the workforce.  The project investigators and postdoctoral researchers at our three institutions will create an integrated, highly collaborative and interdisciplinary consortium of data scientists. We will develop educational tools to aid the dissemination of the methodologies we develop, promoting the efficient use of high dimensional data in the life sciences.<br/><br/>Dramatic increases in the scale and availability of data are profoundly reshaping all domains in the life sciences. Data acquisition and availability from DNA sequencers, environmental sensors, parallel global studies, and imagery (among many others), across time and space, are outpacing our capacity for analysis, including the development of models that represent our knowledge of biological processes. We will address this gap in the life sciences through research and education efforts led by our consortium at the University of Wyoming, the University of Montana, and the University of Nevada?Reno.  We will compete and further develop computational, statistical, and machine learning methods for multi-dimensional data to develop highly predictive and explanatory models for the life sciences. We will test and refine methods and develop critical tools for harnessing the data revolution.  We will apply them to three cross-scale domains within the life sciences and advance our mechanistic understanding of key ecological and evolutionary phenomena. By bringing together a consortium of scientists currently using existing techniques from multiple disciplines, including computer science and applied mathematics, and competing these techniques with simulated and real data, we will evaluate the efficacy of existing methods. Further, we will build on these methods to develop novel hybrid modeling techniques and expanded use of linear and non-linear sparse models to maximize both the predictive accuracy and mechanistic insight of models applied to high dimensional data sets. We will apply these techniques to critical challenges in the life sciences, including mapping phenotypes to genomic data, modeling community dynamics in highly diverse systems, and disentangling the interplay among different temporal scales of drivers in aquatic ecosystems.  In each year our consortium will train a diverse cohort of twelve postdoctoral researchers in modeling techniques and prepare them for the workforce.
