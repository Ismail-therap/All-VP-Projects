Ashlee,

CHS has a duplication in ROAM.  We have two entries for Nurse Education Practice Quality and Retention Simulation Education Training Program.  I entered one and Dean Smith entered one.  The one I entered can be closed.  We are still trying to navigate how CHS faculty and staff will enter information into the system.  I apologize for the extra work that this creates for the Research office.
