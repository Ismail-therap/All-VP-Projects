Hi Ashlee,
 
Our Product Team would like to know if this the only award that is having this issue, whether it be for these specific fields or any other fields?

If you go back and try to modify fields (or populated empty fields) on this award (any fields), and then refresh the page, do the changes persist? If not, can you provide a screenshot of any errors seen in the Network Tab of a Chrome Browser when you attempt to make changes on the record? 

In order to pull up the network tab you will want to right click on the screen, then click on 'inspect' and then navigate to the network tab at the top of the window that opens.
