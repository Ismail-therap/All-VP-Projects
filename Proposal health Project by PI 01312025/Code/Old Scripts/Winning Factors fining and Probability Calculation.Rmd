# Step 1: Load Required Libraries


```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(readr)      # For reading CSV files
library(dplyr)      # For data manipulation
library(readxl)     # For reading Excel files
library(lubridate)  # For handling date-time conversions

```

# Step 2: Load and Process Proposal Data

```{r}
# Read the main Proposal Data file
p_data <- read_csv("C:/Users/mhossa11/OneDrive - University of Wyoming/Projects/Proposal health Project by PI 01312025/Data/Proposal_Data_All_2025_01_31(in).csv")
View(p_data)

# Read the Proposal Cost Data file
Proposal_cost_data_all <- read_csv("C:/Users/mhossa11/OneDrive - University of Wyoming/Projects/Proposal health Project by PI 01312025/Data/Proposal_cost_data_all.csv") %>%
  select(-`Project Title`)  # Remove the "Project Title" column


# Rename columns (except "Proposal #") by appending "in Proposal"
colnames(Proposal_cost_data_all)[-1] <- paste0(colnames(Proposal_cost_data_all)[-1], " in Proposal")

# Merge Proposal Data with Proposal Cost Data on "Proposal #"
p_data <- left_join(p_data, Proposal_cost_data_all, by = "Proposal #")

# Select relevant columns for further processing
