# Loading data

# Step 1: Load Required Libraries


```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(readr)      # For reading CSV files
library(dplyr)      # For data manipulation
library(readxl)     # For reading Excel files
library(lubridate)  # For handling date-time conversions
library(stringr)

```

# Step 2: Load and Process Proposal Data

```{r}
# Read the main Proposal Data file
